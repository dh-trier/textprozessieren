  <em> <b> <u>Prologue</u> </b> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“A long time ago, in a holistic world no further than right here...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Life, had no meaning. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>No purpose, without hatred, violence, war and </em> <em>discrimination.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Though— as you mayght have similarly interpreted, a life </em>without<em> those purpose-propelling tools of bravery, meant a life without choice. And a life without choice, could be argued as impeccably worse than a rocked, free world of chaos. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>In fact, in order to especially realize what a very real, reality of chaos would really look like— a damning reality, thatn’t you may ever acknowledge again— you must first understand that </em>choice, <em>and </em><em>options</em>, <em>were</em> <em>inexplicably what drove your Terran human nature to sin. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>To sin, as in ways of </em>pride<em> and envy, propitiated, by an innate need for greed and a brewing rapture for wrath. And not only was your action to sin inevitable, and proven consistently throughout time... </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It was Politically Incorrect.</em>

</p><p>
  <em> <b>June 16th</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>JAYNE!</em>" Her mother's voice echoed again, drowning out in the waters of her dreams, slowly breaching it's way to the surface.</p><p>She was dreaming of an ocean. Floating romantically in the soft salt smell of the waves— her mind lost in the calls of seagulls, the sunlit waters mist tickling her nose...</p><p>Although, this was all in theory, of course, and that was only what she <em>imagined</em> an ocean would smell, and be like. See, she had never been to a <em>real </em>ocean in person— but somehow in her dreams, she seemed to emulate things in that way, <em>expertly</em> so. Recapturing the mere, careful imagery that displayed itself inside the books she so desperately clung to. Bringing it to <em>life</em>. And that seemed to suit her cruel, longing ache for the outside world— for now, at least—</p><p>"<em>Now</em>, Jayne!"</p><p>Her mind stuttered awake again, this time, her head more fervently above water, "<em>I gave you an extra twenty minutes</em>, come down right now or you're going to be late!"</p><p>She heard that more clearly indeed.</p><p>
  <em>Wait...</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wake up.</em>
</p><p>Jayne Naya Jeevan slowly opened her eyes. Then strained her head up slightly from her pillow, turning over to face the ceiling. She pinched her thumb and forefinger between her brow, blinking long as reality settled in.</p><p><em>Why</em> <em>must she </em><em>leave her </em><em>mind</em> <em>for</em> <em>this</em> <em>place</em>...</p><p>She heaved a breath, kicking her long, dark legs out from the tangled white sheets, sliding over to sit on the edge of her bed. She squinted across the room, focusing up at the hanging, wooden clock opposite her bed, and then froze her vision in sustained relief.</p><p>Oh, 6:20, <em>she had time?</em> </p><p>Her mother could be so dramatic. See, she planned to go to the Schoolhouse a bit earlier today to return her textbooks... but class didn’t start for almost another two whole hours... and wait a minute? A sudden, strong whiff of... <em>something</em> blinded her mind in a different direction.</p><p>Breakfast meat...? That’s strange.</p><p>Oh, but now she could absolutely pinpoint the source to that <em>salty</em> “sea air” of her dreams. Directly to the distracting smell of Crackling Bacon down in the kitchen...</p><p>She stretched up her arms towards the ceiling and smiled with the welcoming notion that it must be paired with Buttered Toast... <em>and</em> hopefully Simmering Sausage. All such oddly normalized motivation... and it was all waiting for <em>her</em> downstairs—  But just as quickly then, a worrying thought snuck into her head, suddenly halting her to pause a moment in curiosity.</p><p>Wait, the Nutrition Schedule didn’t list that for <em>today</em>, though? Something wasn’t right.</p><p>"Jayne!"</p><p><em>Ugh</em>. The nag! "<em>Okayyy</em>, I'm com—" she sing-songed loudly enough for her mother to hear from downstairs. But her voice was sticky, considering she hadn’t spoken yet this morning, so she yelled again, standing up to humour her, “I will be down in a moment.”</p><p>
  <em>So today was Friday...</em>
</p><p>But they weren't supposed to supply bacon on <em>Friday’s </em>in<em> </em>this month’s calendar? </p><p>She padded across her sand-white carpet to cross another day off of her calendar.</p><p>There it was, Friday the sixteenth— and under Nutrition, it only listed, Savory Spinach Omelettes, Rye Toast with Pomegranate Jam, and Daily Essentials (Coffee, Orange Juice, Milk and Water). </p><p>See, her family, and all the neighboring families in her community, received weekly by monthly meal plans for specific days. And today's, was wholesomely incorrect. ...Unless her nose had betrayed her, and then she was imagining this whole crisis for no reason at all.</p><p>"<em>Jayne!</em>"</p><p>She groaned, placing the marker back on the wall shelf. Maybe this was on account for the special occasion, for everyone involved?</p><p>For graduation?</p><p><em>...Oh well. Bacon was downstairs. </em>Jayne reminded herself<em>, well, still hoping she was right...</em></p><p>She slipped on her slippers and bumbled wildly down the winding staircase— not even bothering to check her appearance. She knew she probably looked like how she felt. Chaotic, hungry, and of course, an absolute mess. </p><p>Her normally shiny raven hair was knotted up on top of her head. Dull waves cascading down the sides that had fallen loose over her dark olive blushed cheeks. She knew well that her ancestry related back to India (a country from a long time ago that was apparently inhabited by people who looked like her and her family.) And this was why her, and her brother's skin color were so much darker than everyone else's at school— well, <em>almost</em> everyone.</p><p>See, her town, Pinecone-Paeonia, like every other town she knew existed, had been perfectly organized into sectioned housing units of individual families by culture. <em>Universal Living Communities</em>, were what they were called. Yes, <em>ULC’s</em>, for short, were a perfect containment of generously spaced, pastel colored, two-story houses for every family. Everything they needed was either delivered, or in walking or biking distance. </p><p>Oh, and more importantly, the weather of her town was most sincerely spectacular. It consisted of bright, misty, sunny summers, cool crisp autumns, and stone-cold white winters- and <em>that</em> was Jayne’s favorite aspect about her town. She <em>loved</em> the change.</p><p>Each town contained one Hospital, supplied with one Ambulance Truck. One Library. One Gym. One Shopping Mall. One Movie Theater. One Restaurant. One Concert Hall. One Labratory. One Art Museum. One Bar. One Salon. One Bowling Alley. One Community Garden. One Football Stadium. One Gymnasium. One Dog Park. One Police Station. One Firehouse. One Schoolhouse, with one School Park Playground, as well as it’s thirteen, separately attached sub buildings for each progressing year.</p><p>And every town looked like this.</p><p>Though, she was sure that not <em>every</em> town had the special trees and weather like Pinecone-Paeonia (she had read about other towns of extreme, year-round heat in her geography books), she knew for a fact that every town had the exact same resources. And keep in mind, that yes, there were only <em>one</em> of these buildings per town, but each one alone was magnificent in size.</p><p>And in each town, like hers, each family’s house, represented a different country. One of each, for lack of a better phrase- in fact, Pinecone-Paeonia had even less of a variety of represented countries than other towns (coming in at only about 11% of all world countries,) as Pinecone-Paeonia was mostly a collection of Eastern Europe. </p><p>To name them all, they were:</p><p>Poland, Switzerland, Israel, Ukraine, Romania, Germany, France, Spain, Turkey, Greece, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Austria, Italy, Syria, Iceland, England, Iran and Ireland. And then there was her, from India. And then next to her, the other outcast was Kenya. Though she knew India originally was not exactly <em>close</em> to Eastern Europe... somehow they, and Kenya ended up in Pinecone-Paeonia. Because that was equality... and that was diversity. Although she was <em>sure</em> that the two were meant to be different things. And her friend Timothy, and his younger sister Cassidy, from Kenya, actually had much darker skin than her. And unadmittingly so, she did feel slightly less excluded because of their presence. Though that ironically made her feel worse, in a way. And Timothy always knew how to make her laugh.</p><p>She wished she could care <em>half</em> as less about her self-image the way Tim could. And their town was a lower populated town, so they needed to have less of a variety... and that was a prospect of equality- <em>by definition</em>, of course. Not by her own opinion. Considering she lived in “Pinecone-Paeonia” and had zero insight as to where that was now or what country that <em>used</em> be a part of.</p><p>There were 999,999 other towns all over the world- and she wouldn’t dare try to list them all, but most of them, at least had a larger spectrum of countries (coming in at usually greater than 45%... It wasn’t fair.) But she couldn't complain though. She lived a comfortable life— as well did everyone else. And there was nothing to covet, as it was all... the same.</p><p>And although she felt isolated in her own skin, she was still enviously described as classically beautiful by her mother and best friend Diana. Attributing that to her striking, light bearing hazel eyes and strong, symmetrical features— which, was what she <em>thought</em> physical beauty <em>should</em> be depicted by and <em>only</em>.</p><p>She was average in height and weight, and had a short, straight nose and high cheekbones. And her dark brows were full— accenting the rounded, yet angular definition of her features. However, unfortunately, and according to many— like a certain, Miss Perfect, <em>Johanna Jensen</em>, if something or someone was <em>different</em>, then it wasn't the same- and if it wasn't the same, then <em>that</em> meant, that it couldn't be perfect.</p><p>Perfect... to fit in with the rest of the all too seemingly perfect world she lived in. And perfect she was not.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>

  <em> <b>Chapter Two: Change is the Essential Process of All Existence</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>Friday, 6:36 AM</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>June 16th</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Jayne stepped into the kitchen to see her father reading the newspaper with one hand and sipping a steaming, hot cup of coffee in the other. Under the table was her family’s pet dog, Bongo- a panting, black and chestnut haired German Sheppard. He lifted his head up gently as she walked in.</p><p>Their wooden cabinet and white-tile kitchen always felt claustraphobically tidy, although it was more than spacious. However, it was the creaky, oakwood flooring, warmly placed furniture and quietly arranged white marble island, that actually made it bearable and even quite cozy.</p><p>Jayne watched as a strip of sunlight drenched a beam of light across the round wooden table that her father was sat at, right in front of the big, square window. She thought that the image as a whole— with the blurry, windowed background of soft green hills and concrete buildings outside— was breath-taking in the moment. Granted, every kitchen looked the way theirs did, but it was moments like this, in which she recognized the tiny specks of dust floating in the sunlight, that reminded Jayne that her home could be special.</p><p>"Morning, Jane," her father said hoarsely, and then cleared his throat. "Sleep well?"</p><p>"Yes," she stared absently at his black and gray work tie. “Absolutely.”</p><p>She then felt his eyes examine her heavily, particularly focusing in on her nose-ring with judgement. He closed his eyes languidly with a small sigh. (Jayne saw an old photograph in a history book once, and since then, she had been forever mesmerized by the picture’s captivating, colorful group of young Indian women. She had never admired a photograph so distinctly. As they all had these elegant, nose-ring chains— and the most beautiful red clothes Jayne had ever seen. So on her sixteenth birthday, she got her nose pierced, like them- with her mother’s permission, of course, and she wore the golden hoop in honor... of her past culture. Her mother saw it as representation. Her father saw it as rebellion. Jayne might admit she saw it as something between the two.) She self-consciously felt over the thin, gold metal that looped through her left nostril.</p><p>And if there's something anyone must know, it is that her father didn't approve of Jayne's scandalous personality most of the time. And he especially did not approve of her persistent desire to change her given name.</p><p>She could just <em>tell</em> when he was calling her "Jane.”</p><p><em>Oh, how she wished</em> she had a long, beautiful name like one from her ancestry- a name from a time when people spoke languages <em>other</em> than just the Standard. Yes, a name from her books- like Priyanka or Latika, or even just a long, pretty name in general. Like <em>Persephone. </em>And it's not that she hated her real name. Jane. It's just that, <em>Jane</em>... was so utterly plain. And she did not want a name— that she had <em>no choice</em> in deciding, by the way— to define her. Boxing her in to that plain, <em>Jane</em>, boring lifestyle. One that so pathetically advertised itself to her everywhere.</p><p>So, all she was asking... was to simply add a "y" in her name. Or to call her "Jay." And her father had sarcastically responded that that was very fitting of her... to add a "y" in, because "<em>why</em>" was a word she used far-terribly too often.</p><p>"Father. This breakfast is <em>exquisite</em>," Jayne beamed, plopping down in the seat next to him. He twitched an amused, heavy brow at her, the mug still resting just under his mustache. A weary look started to grow on his face, now dropping the newspaper to the table.</p><p>"You know, Jane..." he touched his shadowed-throat gingerly, clearing it again, "You're eighteen. That’s an adult now. Things are going to start to change for you, very fast, and very soon." He pushed up the bridge of his dark maroon, framed glasses, tilting his chin down to look at her more sternly, "You need to start taking on more responsibility for yourself. Your mother shouldn't still be waking you up for school."</p><p>Jayne rolled her eyes. "All right. Well, soon after today, she won't have to. I won’t be here."</p><p><em>Yes,</em> after today.</p><p>Because today, was the last day of school. And it was the last day, for the last <em>time</em>. The last, <em>last</em> day of Primary school! Oh, the deeply embedded thrill of new possibilities had been lately too overwhelming. </p><p>Her father actually chuckled at that. "Oh... my dear. You worry me." He took a bite of his scrambled eggs, as Jayne's mother stepped back into the kitchen, carrying Jayne's bright yellow schoolbag. </p><p>"You left your essay on the dining room table. I put it back in your folder." Her mother threw a glance at her knowingly. "I’m surprised, Mr. Gellert has you doing work on the last day? "</p><p>Hmm. Maybe her father was right...</p><p>But where would there be an opportunity, to be <em>responsible</em> at home... when her <em>mother</em> was around?</p><p>"Thank you, mother, but I <em>would</em> have seen it, if you had only given me the chance." She then took a long swig of her orange juice, washing down her eggs. "And yes, it’s something he wanted to revisit with our class, but it’s not much. The essay's just about our expectations for College, which we'll all share today." She carefully leaned over the table to fork some sausage and bacon. "We're actually <em>only </em>doing College Preparation today."</p><p>"Oh, the final days of College Preparation, how <em>excited</em> everyone must be!" Her mother sighed dreamily, placing a hand on her husband's shoulder. "I can remember when I was still the only person I knew in Oak-Lily Town— besides my parents, of course— that was of Indian descent..." she exhaled again wistfully. "Then I met your father, of course.”</p><p>”Of course.” Jayne echoed flatly.</p><p>”Yes, well, it just seems like a lifetime ago. Sometimes I think about how lucky we were— chosen, to have another baby when we did, Jayne. Your father and I weren't so lucky growing up."</p><p>Her father nodded dutifully, "Yes, it really makes a probable difference, I would imagine. Knowing someone else your age, who comes from the same place." He shrugged to Jayne, easing an easy smile. “It matters immensely.”</p><p><em>Yes, but you and mother </em>both<em> had classmates from Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Sri Lanka, Mali, Iraq, Korea, Haiti, Brazil, Taiwan, Libya, Niger, Africa and Pakistan.  Albeit, much more diverse than here,</em> she thought. It was just her and her brother. <em>They couldn’t even compare to </em>imagine <em>how alone she felt. </em></p><p>"Though you are still going to see plenty others like you in College. And from towns all over." Her father smirked cheekily to her mother, and then peered back at Jayne. "You know, don't look so surprised, Jane... Because one day, you and <em>your</em> Life Mate are going to be saying the same thing, to your child."</p><p>He boomed a deep, hearty laugh at Jayne's blatant look of horror, and then at her mother, as she chimed in with mirth, "Or <em>children</em>, John? We can only hope!"</p><p>"All right— Can we <em>not</em> talk about this please?" Jayne said bitterly, swallowing down some more juice. "By the way, why do we have breakfast meat privileges today? It's Friday?" </p><p>"<em>Wow...</em>" Her brother, Samuel said, dragging out the word dryly. He huffed haughtily to their father, strolling into the kitchen through the other doorway. "I bet father my tie you wouldn't have noticed," he chuckled at her teasingly, leaning tall against the wood frame, already dressed in his blue and silver school uniform.</p><p>"Well, Ha-ha. I did. So what's the deal?"</p><p>Her younger brother only rolled his eyes as her answer, before remarking, “Come on, Jayne.”</p><p>She squinted back at him impatiently. Sometimes, Sam could barely even say anything, and the mere sight of his expression would make her angry. See Sam was tall and lean, and had an array of dark curly hair splayed in an even mess across his forehead. He looked older than her, but he still had another year left of Primary School. So his biting tone was just due to his jealousy, she decided.</p><p>”Father?” Jayne asked.</p><p>Sam glanced lazily at his father when he put down his paper again. And just then, Jayne noticed the big, bold words on the front, title page that made her stomach flutter.</p><p><em>Graduates of Yesterday, Collegates of Tomorrow. A Happy Life Awaits.</em> <em>Goodluck Class of the Present!</em></p><p>"Service gave it to us earlier this week. We thought you’d enjoy it for today. All the graduates received the same complement," her father shook his paper open again to a new page.</p><p>The Bad News section.</p><p>Jayne had always taken curious notice that this section of the paper was typically vapid. And there was <em>never</em> a time she could remember that the news had ever caused her parents to panic or to remark anything other than, "Oh, well, that was a close one."</p><p>Their newspaper covered her and her nine neighboring towns and that was it. Pinecone-Paeonia, Rose-Blossom, Olive-Wood, Pepper-Leaf, Lily-Juniper, Orange-Tree, Oak-Lily, Chestnut-Clover, Cinnamon-Grass and Sage-Vine. They heard nothing ever of the other 999,990 towns that assumingly had the same, low production of Bad News as them. Which was a good thing... because nothing Bad ever happened in the world of today. Ever.</p><p><em>She often wondered the </em><em>real</em> <em>purpose of a newspaper. </em>Was it to<em> </em>let people know about the Bad Things that... <em>could</em> have happened? But didn't?</p><p>Today said:</p><p>
  <em>“Firemen save kitten from tree before fall.”</em>
</p><p><em>(</em>It<em> </em>said<em> that </em>almost every other week. And yet still, her mother always smiled with relief, every time.<em>)</em></p><p>
  <em>“Boy rescued before kidnapping.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Girl stopped by police before attempted theft.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Missing child; precautionary mission successful.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Total accounted arrests: 2”</em>
</p><p>"That's what I assumed." Jayne smiled, thoughtfully ignoring her dogged, troubling curiosity that so pathetically controlled her thoughts, taking her last bite of sausage. She had been eating rather quickly, as she kind-of began to realize that she <em>didn’t</em> have as much time as she thought. (Time perception was <em>not </em>her strongest attribute, if one could guess.) Her brother sat down in the chair next to her, sliding a plate over. "You are the only person I know to get this fixated over just breakfast."</p><p>"It's not just about the breakfast, Sam-Mule." Jayne huffed, "It's about the schedule <em>change.</em>” She peered at her father, and then behind him, at where the window sunbeam once was. It had now shifted over, highlighting their dusty, hanging family portrait. “Change is the essential process of all existence.”</p><p>Sam gave her a look. A pretend-sad look, that she knew all too well from him. “Sure...” he nodded, twitching a condescending frown. “Jay, that makes complete sense.”</p><p>She mocked a frown back. “Well, I just think that it’s a wonderfully new way to start the day, is all," she exclaimed on a whim, hiccuping with her mouth half-full. “It’s a promising symbol of my future.” She stood up fast, her chair squeaking a wretched sound against the tile floor.</p><p>"Jayne, <em>slow down</em>..." Her mother reprimanded, taking the plate from her hands as a precaution. "Now, just go get dressed. I'll clean up for you."</p><p>"Thank you! Yes!" She kissed her mother's cheek, skipping then measurably up the hall, only to bound up the staircase when she was out of sight.</p><p>She knew this was what her father meant by needing to take on more of her own responsibility. But she supposed there was no harm in taking advantage of these last few weeks that she was home? Before she was <em>really </em>on her own.</p><p>How hard could simple tasks really be anyway? Laundry, dishes... cooking? Those things weren't complex or <em>difficult</em> to figure out...</p><p>But that's just it. <em>They were </em>easy<em> tasks.</em></p><p>And easy tasks like that, were just such a <em>chore </em>for her.</p><p>Though, not to sound all <em>too</em> entirely immature, because it wasn't just that- but it was that she truly, rather enjoyed spending her time and effort, on things that were more <em>important</em>... or interesting to her.</p><p>
  <em>Like dreaming. Or theorizing life in her head. Or reading. </em>
</p><p>Oh right, <em>could Jayne Naya Jeevan</em> <em>read</em>...</p><p>She could read for hours and <em>hours</em> <em>upon hours </em>and not even take notice the time. She once read all of <em>Jane Eyre</em> in just three days! (She was most especially motivated the first time she read it because of her name.) Though on another note to that, they were only allowed Library visits on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, so she did read it on three <em>separate</em> days altogether, but still... she was proud of herself. Jayne would binge books without sleep if she could, yes.</p><p>Her teacher, Mr. Gellert, actually once gave her a book in her ninth year of school, in secret, to <em>keep</em>. That was one of her most darkest secrets that only Diana knew about.</p><p>And Mr. Gellert left her the gift, hidden with her new school book order— and a note, telling her, that his father, when he was a boy, somehow <em>took it from his father, </em>and by some miracle, never got caught. He had thought Jayne was worthy enough for it's merit when he apparently found it again in his attic one day, as it had no use in his classroom (because it didn't have the same, normal binding and cover that all books had to have today.) And even more alarmingly so, (or interestingly to Jayne,) was that it had said a <em>name </em>on the cover. <em>Her</em> name, to be exact. And instead of the plain, brown leather casing and gold letters for the lone title, it had a colorful, hand-drawn, <em>illustrated </em>cover. And then <em>her</em> name, under the title. Well, her first name, to be exact. Mr. Gellert wrote explicitly to never show it to anyone. So naturally, it became her ultimate-favorite novel, by choice.</p><p>There weren't too many books to choose from at the Library for entertainment, but she still treasured them as such. There were the classics, and some of these ones were her favorites: <em>The Great Gatsby, </em><em>A Tale of Two Cities, Wuthering Heights, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Oliver Twist, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Charlotte’s Web, To Save A Mockingbird... </em> And of course, her <em>ultimate</em> favorite— the beloved novel that <em>belonged</em> to her, that she read over and over and over again (in Closed-Door-Time, of course.) And each different time she read it, she found a new meaning within the pages, <em>a new way to look at the story.</em> It was truly the one gift she would protect with her life, hidden and tucked away in her dresser drawer.</p><p><em>Pride and Prejudice.</em>.. by <em>Jane</em> Austen. This was why she didn't completely hate her given name. Because she shared it with someone as special, as Jane Austen. Jayne believed her to be the original writer, but that was merely a prospect of her impossible imagination. But oh, how she dreamed of one day, meeting someone as handsome and intelligent and... <em>interesting</em> as, Mr. Darcy. Someone who tried to understand her... because everyone else could not. Someone misunderstood by everyone... that <em>she</em> could try and understand.</p><p>However, as much time as she spent reading escape fiction, she also quite enjoyed spending her time studying. Though, the subject matter <em>was</em> coincidentally never what was assigned for school. (It was infinite what Jayne could accomplish when she was supposed to be doing something else.) And there were many non-fiction books she loved to explore— specifically, about detail-world history, the human body, medicine, space, electricity, animals, art, sports, and so on...</p><p>Jayne loved to learn more than <em>anything</em> in the entire world and <em>that</em> was what she was most especially anticipating about College. Six whole years to learn how to live her <em>Dream Life</em>.</p><p>
  <em> <b>College. </b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Prepare for your Dream Life. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your Assignments await!</em>
</p><p>That was another Advertisement she saw in the paper earlier this week. And it gave her the butterflies. But not the good kind— the <em>bad butterflies</em>.</p><p><em>What Dream Career would be assigned to her?</em> A doctor? A writer? <em>An actress?</em> She would love to live in Holly-Wood town with all of the other actors and actresses. Oh, that would be so divine...</p><p>Or maybe she would be a teacher? Her mother believed this would be her destiny, as that was what she was assigned at her age. (She had taught Jayne’s class in second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth year, which had been a dramatic source of trauma for Jayne.)</p><p>There were so many possibilities for her future and they vivaciously kept her awake at night— imagining and imagining and imagining it all. Regardless, she would find out her Dream Career very soon. And she couldn't wait to start preparing to be the best person fit for her destiny job— researching once she found out her title, yes, she would get right to work!</p><p><em>And if that wasn't enough to make her mind spin, </em>she always fell back on compulsively imagining what her ideal husband would be like...</p><p>Or wife... possibly? Though she was quite certain she had only had crushes on boys in Primary school, she was still open for anything that she knew was supposed to be her destiny. </p><p>Though why did she still feel, as if her heart was squeezed in too tight for her chest, and her stomach bubbling with malintentioned butterflies?</p><p>Her fate was in sure hands, she reminded herself. And she didn't exactly understand the process behind those hands, or even <em>who those hands belonged to</em>, but regardless of those things, she knew her assignments were going to be correct, <em>for </em><em>her</em>. As her parents, her friends' parents, her teachers, the television, the newspapers, even Johanna Jensen— <em>everyone— </em>had all put such faith in the system.</p><p>Such faith in the system, that was in the duty behind the <em>Life Officers</em>...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>

  <em> <b>Chapter Three: Life Officer Atheism</b></em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>Friday, 7:04 AM</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>June 16th</b></em>
</p><hr/><p>Yes right, the system behind the Life Officers... and their responsibility. Their dutiful responsibility.</p><p>Jayne walked into her room and heard the familiar mechanical sound of the security camera in her ceiling room corner when she closed the door. A camera, by obvious law of privacy, would shut down to angle towards the ground when a bedroom door closed or a washroom door closed. Though one was only allowed a certain amount of Closed-Door-Time (CDT, for short) a day, and rightfully so, because a person, truthfully, only needed that time to bathe, change, and use the toilet. (And in Jayne's case, it was also to occasionally read <em>Pride and Predjudice </em>in private.)</p><p>And a person's CDT hours were tracked monthly... so if one were spending a lot of CDT in a short period of time, well, then one was carefully reexamined for an explanation of valid reasoning.</p><p>But everywhere else outside CDT... the red-eyed cameras lurked and swayed their heads as she passed by. And not just stationary ones, but the drones were what really drove her anxiety. Small, white drones, about the size of a grapefruit— followed her casually throughout her own house... throughout the Schoolhouse... throughout the Gym, at Movie Theater Thursdays, the Library, the Backyard woods, Diana's house, the Football Stadium, Shopping Mall Mondays (those were bi-monthly)— <em>everywhere</em>.</p><p>And the <em>Life Officers</em> were always watching. Well, when they were on duty. Obviously, no one knew when that was, so you <em>pretended</em> like they were watching at all times, just to be safe.</p><p>They were the masterminds behind Jayne's everyday life. Behind <em>everybody's</em> individual, everyday life. <em>For safety, security, and sanity</em>, was their motto.</p><p><em>Worry less, live more</em>.</p><p>Jayne sat on her bed, throwing off her t-shirt, the springs of the mattress cringing the same sound whenever she collapsed back onto it. She couldn't wait to lay in a new bed. To just be somewhere new for once.</p><p>As she stepped in her white stockings, and then slipped on her green and silver, checkered-stitched uniform dress, Jayne was imagining who she would still see around in College that was from Pinecone-Paeonia. All she wanted was Diana. Her darling, beautiful best friend for ever and ever, which they had pledged to each other exactly when they were eight. What was she going to do without her? She didn't want a new best friend— or rather, she didn’t want a <em>Roommate</em><em> at all,</em> for that matter... What if her assigned Roommate was mean? What if she didn't like her? What if her assigned husband-<em>Life Mate</em>-whatever... <em>didn't like her? What if she didn’t like her assigned clubs or extra curricular activities? Or worse, what if she was placed on a sports team?! </em></p><p>And once more, her mind drifted on thinking about what it would be like if she were to be assigned a Life Mate— assigned to <em>marry... </em>somebody... like <em>Adam Alanis. </em></p><p>And<em> Adam Alanis </em>was assigned to the same campus as her<em>, </em>so it fueled her imagination even more so<em>. </em>He was someone, she knew she already liked, and someone she knew already liked her. Well, <em>enjoyed</em> being friends with her, at least. He was effortlessly funny, nice, thoughtful, unfairly attractive and he always stuck up for her. Yes, to be assigned Adam Alanis would truly be a dream.</p><p>But could it be her real Dream? </p><p>She sighed out loud through her nose.</p><p><em>No</em>... <em>It </em>couldn't<em> possibly be her Dream.</em> Because Adam Alanis wasn't <em>like</em> her. No, he wasn't like her in the right way that he had to be, <em>like</em> her...</p><p>Though that didn't stop her imagination. In fact, she had imagined in class often, about what it would be like to touch his skin. When he was sitting so close, right next to her, the color did come awfully close to her skin tone, with his forearm flexed next to hers. And see, Adam's family ancestry traced back to represent the country Greece. And he would even get as dark as her in the summers— sometimes darker— but Diana said that unfortunately didn't count.</p><p>It wasn't <em>about</em> being the same exact skin color. Because sometimes that didn't happen, and a person was assigned a Life Mate who was just a tone darker or lighter than they were.</p><p>It was <em>about</em> the place and the blood. Roots that were ever so evident in purified family features.</p><p>All to support the vitally, important law of intent. That we had to actively preserve race to sustain diversity and equality. Which Jayne had always felt equally indecisive about ethically. Why were things this way so? Why did she <em>have to</em> marry someone who was like her? Would that really be such a crime?</p><p>She wanted a person.</p><p>No, <em>Jayne wanted a</em> <em>mind,</em> not a face. </p><p>She exhaled softly, thinking about a dream she had once where it <em>was</em> about the <em>person</em>. He reminded her of Mr. Darcy, as he was just as quiet, though slightly less arrogant. He was <em>still</em> arrogant though... just in a different way, and that made him so much more interesting to her— and she didnt even know why. But in her dreams his face was just as handsome— and well, she didn’t know exactly <em>how</em> or why he was handsome, but oh, was he ever so <em>extremely,</em> intoxicatingly handsome. And to Jayne especially.</p><p>Though, however graphically she did indeed “see” him in her dream, she believed that she did not perceive his attractiveness through sight— because she couldn’t even recall his hair color. Or his skin color for that matter. But it was only a dream, and a dream, was all it ever would be.</p><p>Because her dreams at night were not real.</p><p><em>Her Dream </em>Life<em> however, was a reality. That was very real. And about to happen for her very soon.</em></p><p>After brushing her hair quickly, she tied back half of her thick, dark waves with a golden ribbon that her mother gave to her three years ago (to match her <em>radiant</em> eyes, she said.) Adam had radiant eyes, Jayne had thought helplessly. She wondered if Adam had ever thought about her in the way she thought of him. </p><p>She knew it was useless to worry about, but she just couldn't help it. And soon, she would be matched up with a <em>stranger...</em> and so would he... and that would be the end of the ever-relentless, Adam-thoughts.</p><p>Yes, Jayne's incessant, compulsive thoughts were almost, as disgraceful as her poor impulse control. Or her stubborness. Or her anxiety... Or her need to be right all the time. Or her inability to stop the words before they were already out of her mouth.</p><p>How on earth would her Life Officer ever be able to find someone to balance out her terrible personality flaws? What would that balance even look like?</p><p>She didn't understand how an Si (a <em>Supreme </em><em>Intuition </em>gene carrier— better known, as by their job title: <em>Life Officer</em>) conjugated the conclusions that they came to in the first place. How did they choose the correct “Life” for her to live? Did they yet? What really was ‘Supreme Intuition’? </p><p>She only knew from what she had been taught in class, and that these <em>people... </em>had an extra sensory perception. A born, benign “cancerous” growth in the brain. A tiny, harmless brain tumor, that eventually stopped growing on its own. (Which took history a measurable amount of time to discover, let alone research.) And the growth was onset to the pineal gland, to be exact, plausibly caused over time by genetic mutation.</p><p>A slight, detectable mutation in the already oddly-shaped segment of the brain— the segment that controlled a person’s daily release of DMT (the neuro chemical, N-Dimethyltryptamine, though more widely known, as the alkaloid responsible for one’s nightly dreams.)</p><p>It was a barely-there mutation, which biologists first discovered as an extremely dramatic, ten-year curve increase in intellect and IQ... all over the world. Then after generations of targeting those dominant-gened individuals, and examining their morphed pineal glands in autopsies— loosely connecting it to the nearly undetectable, specific-i infant tumor, they came to the final concluded theory of Superior Intuition. The Si gene— which could then a decade later, be tested for at birth. But what did all that mean? There was no evidence of this anywhere that she could see as proof. No photographs or videos. Just words. Why should she believe something like that so blindly? How was reading a “history” textbook supposed to be proof of something she wasn’t around to witness herself?</p><p>Something just didn’t seem right about it.</p><p>She’d also been taught that since long after that discovery... since way, <em>way</em> long after that discovery... Since after the Si Crime Officers ‘career’ debut... and after the <em>highly</em> protested, “Si Living Community Separation Laws”, after the marketing, and the exploitation, and the multiple-decade taking movement away from the fragile life of war, then after the constructed establishment of ULC’s— and then the re-establishment of College... When the Si, <em>Life</em> <em>Officers</em> began designing “Life” as Jayne knew it today, there had since, <em>never</em> been a person to complain about... their Life.</p><p><em>Never</em>.</p><p>Their chosen lives were praised and gloriously gratified. Population was under control again. Crime rate was down 100%, 100% of the time. People were happy. People rarely got sick. People rarely got hurt. How was that kind of immaculate pressure managed?</p><p>And she'd been reminded time, and <em>time again</em>, that Si’s had been trained since birth, to watch over their one specific person (OSP, for short), to help maintain control, order, and peace within our world society. And they were celebrated, and honored, and <em>prayed </em>to... as some kind-of, a guardian of sorts.</p><p>Though it was only their job. Jayne had always thought, and it was silly, because an Si gathered information on their OSP via random audio and visual camera. Then they collected more data via written and scored transcripts of academic, emotional, social or personality exams. (The AESOP Curriculum Tests, or ACTs, which Jayne had studied for, for <em>months</em>.)</p><p>So then what else was there to “extra sense” Life Officers?</p><p>This infuriated Jayne as she had learned over and over about bio-photonic energy... cellular light emission... the heightened intuitive ability responsible for extra sensory perception... and <em>whatever that all even meant</em>, she still couldn't fathom. Because, it was a <em>sense</em> that she<em> did not have!</em></p><p>And all she’d ever been told was to trust the system that already works.</p><p>But sometimes, her ten year old self wondered if Si’s (believed honestly and ridiculously by many adults) really experienced actual <em>epiphanies. </em>Like a genie might, she imagined, suddenly formulating a sudden, clear picture in their heads of the future.</p><p>Or was their “extra sense” just due to an unimaginable, extremely incomprehensible intellect where they calculated all types of probabilities and factors in order to organize insight into a probable future? She thinks that’s the more probable answer.</p><p>How could they logistically know Jayne’s deepest desires that she never spoke of? Because, she didn’t <em>think</em> she knew of them yet? How were they going to arrange her “Dream Life” before she even knew the dream herself?</p><p><em>Surely it would be, of course, her Dream—</em> she looked up at the camera in her room, like, even though it were faced down, they were somehow listening to her thoughts— <em>and it would be what she always sincerely wanted... The way her future was supposed to be... </em></p><p>
  <em>But was that still really her choice?</em>
</p><p>Did that question even <em>matter</em>, if she was going to be happy in the end?</p><p>Or what her more rational brain always told her, was obviously that it was all a hoax.</p><p>
  <em>An effortless way to instill fear in a controlled society.</em>
</p><p>Was anyone really watching her? </p><p>Or did they just match up everyone with a corresponding country-mate and assorted gender and be done with it?</p><p>Because the insightful beings that she had learned about her entire life, honestly sounded completely inhuman to her... so realistically, she couldn’t help but question their existence.</p><p>Well, who wouldn’t?</p><p>Why should she believe in something that defied science and logic in every way she’d ever been taught elsewhere, and then be expected not to question it?</p><p>Like how many of them were there? <em>Where</em> were they living? ...<em>What did they look like?</em></p><p>She was helplessly skeptical of it all, as it always seemed to her, like it would fit perfectly in one of her fantasy/science fiction novels. Exactly like, <em>The Odyssey, </em>she imagined<em>... </em></p><p><em>Yes, </em>Jayne<em> had </em>secretly always imagined Si’s to look like the creepy, ugly creatures they stood for. Just like <em>Cyclops</em>... Hyper-examining society with their giant, singular red eyes, humorously hiding behind the <em>public,</em> red-eyes that Jayne had shrunk beneath every day of her life.</p><p>Or maybe they were different and even more fictional than Cyclops— sorcering, as scraggly, scheming <em>witches... </em>or grumpy, old<em> toad-goblins, </em>sitting inches away from their giant television screen— gaping thoughtlessly at the blaring, blinking image of Jayne’s face... just like it were <em>Cartoon Morning Sunday!</em></p><p>She giggled out loud, lying back on her bed. <em>Who was the unlucky being that watched and studied her for years upon years that she would never get to know? They must think she to be crazy.</em> It didn't seem fair really. Jayne kind of felt bad for them. Like they were forced to live this life of unrequited confinement, while she lived about freely on the other side of the screen. Outside their work hours they obviously slept when they had to, and ate, and conversed with each other. But did they have real lives too, with real families like her?</p><p>Why couldn’t she be taught <em>this</em> in school? Why did that seem to be some kind of a secret? What <em>else </em>wasn’t she taught? What else wasn’t she taught <em>accurately</em>?</p><p>Surely, though they must do <em>something</em> other than plan their OSP’s lives, predict crime and report. Although, maybe that <em>was</em> fulfilling? To feel such protection over the one person they knew better than themselves, and then to save them from harm's way when the time came? To plan their future happiness... ever so tragically without them?</p><p>But on the contrary then, what about the reverse? Wouldn't that feel like the lowest kind of betrayal when/if they fatefully realize they have to report their own OSP... for a crime that they were only (subjectively) <em>planning</em> to do? </p><p>Well, it was only their <em>job</em>, Jayne thought again. And it was for the better and safety of society. Why did she have to make everything so romantical?</p><p>If <em>she</em> knew someone were about to commit a crime and endanger their own life or someone else’s, she knew she would absolutely have the courage to report it. No matter who it was. Yes, she surely could.</p><p>”Jayne?” She suddenly heard her mother calling from up the stairs. Jayne huffed quietly— in expected, yet however now growing, frustration.</p><p><em>And why did people </em>want<em> to commit crimes in the first place?</em> Did they <em>want</em> to, or was it because they had to?—</p><p>Relax, Jayne— she told her anxiety, now acknowledging the swallowing, suffocating seduction of far-fetched fantasy that had so easily sucked her in. It always did.</p><p>These were the infinite questions that haunted her every day of her life.</p><p>And it was only morning... Yes, this was a very typical morning of thinking for Jayne.</p><p>And nobody would ever know. Nobody ever did. As these were the ideas and the questions that she was never allowed to voice.</p><p>So they just... stayed trapped, forever in her head. Circling round and round and round.</p><p>She had tried asking her mother about these things once, but her mother’s eyes grew wide and she hushed her instantly. "Don't ask about things like that, sweetie. You needn’t worry about adult things like that."</p><p>She tried asking her father once, but he became immediately irate and, in an attempt to scare her, he warned, "To ask about crime, means one thinks about crime. And crime is WRONG. Don't ever speak about that again."</p><p>But Samuel, her brother, was the <em>only one</em> who understood her fascination with the outside world. Not even Diana understood. She was <em>so </em>afraid, actually.</p><p>However though, recently in the past year, with Samuel, there was this one time... Well, he had said the most explicitly radical words Jayne had ever heard him voice aloud. Words that had actually concerned her more than any words she had ever heard from anyone else before. And soon after that, she stopped asking for their weekly secret, closed-door-conversations. Because it had shocked her, as completely unexpected to be honest. Because Sam told her that sometimes, he thinks that one day, he actually wants to <em>commit a crime</em>, just to see what else was out there. Jayne had fallen quiet in that moment and asked if he really wished for that. To which, he replied no, by simply smiling and shaking his head... but Jayne <em>knew</em> there was something deep down he wasn't telling her. </p><p>If Samuel's Si reported him for an arrest... And then, he got <em>taken</em> <em>away</em>... to well, <em>that place, where they take away criminals</em>... She didn’t even like thinking the name. She didn't know what she would do—</p><p>"Jayne!" Her mother knocked loud, making her flinch violently from her thoughts, before swinging open her door. "I've been calling you? You've been in there a long time, what's wrong?"</p><p>She heard the camera instantly wake up and straighten it’s neck towards them. Zeroing in on the sound.</p><p>
  <em>Why must she panic over nothing?</em>
</p><p>Her mother sighed deeply upon seeing Jayne reclined on her back, her brow still furrowed in irritation and from intense thought. Jayne reluctantly relaxed her expression, still staring up at her paved, iced vanilla ceiling.</p><p>"Sorry. Just thinking."</p><p>"You're going to daydream your life away, if you don't get up and move." Her mother said gravely. "Let's go. Diana is down by the road and ready to go."</p><p>“Diana? Oh...” Jayne lugged her body up theatrically. She leaned up on her elbows, then looked up slowly at her mother. ”I think... that my last ride to school with Diana, strangely, is <em>not</em> as exciting as it was about an hour ago,” she said solemnly.</p><p>“Ah.” Her mother pursed her lips to the side in understanding. “You certainly always had a motive for procrastination. Whether you knew of it or not, that’s a different matter.” She smiled apologetically, or more rather, nostalgically. (Not like she were feeling sad for Jayne, but because <em>she</em> once had a childhood best friend too. Jayne knew they hadn’t written to each other since College.)</p><p>“Do you have all of your books?”</p><p>”Yes.” Jayne motioned to downstairs. “I told you. I already put the four big ones in my backpack and three little in my basket.”</p><p>”All <em>right</em>...” her mother backed away with a waved hand up in surrender. “I was just checking.” Then she winced a grin, “I just hope you’re prepared for the exercise.”</p><p>Jayne held her tongue, as she knew her mother was only trying to help. Because there was no obvious way that all of her heavy textbooks could possibly fit in her school bag without the added, extra room in her bike basket. She had stupidly waited for the last minute to return them all at once— and now, she was facing the consequences. One of them being in the form of a very, rough ride.</p><p>Jayne followed her out into the hall, as she saw her mother’s dark violet, painted lips begin to slip, revealing a previously withheld, wise expression. Like she had been waiting to tell Jayne something wildly important, all along.</p><p>"Jayne, I must say, don’t be too upset.” She said, guiding a veined hand down the spiral railing around the steps. Her smile, much more evident now. “You know, I actually think that Diana has a surprise for you."</p><p>Jayne shrugged down the steps, now processing that a bit more thoroughly.</p><p>Wait... a surprise could only mean—</p><p>She got in. Diana got in! She knew it would happen!</p><p>She skidded down the last few steps with a quick skip and grabbed her heavy, yellow backpack off the end of the railing. She lugged it over her shoulder then faced her mother with a growing, hopeful expression, “...Did she get in?” she asked excitedly.</p><p>Her mother only smirked. “I don’t know...” she lingered, “you need to go see her yourself.” </p><p>That was enough of an answer for Jayne. She yelled goodbye, and was out the door in a heartbeat. A heartbeat— she loved to say that.</p><p>As her mother shut the door, Jayne took one deep breath, staring up into the clear sky before hopping on her bike to catch up to Diana. But she paused, wanting to remember this moment, on her last day of school. How she felt, how the fiery sun was shining, how the air smelled warm and fresh. How the grass was so green and the sky was so blue— and then she felt a sudden pang of loneliness. </p><p>Why? <em>Why now</em>?</p><p>This kind of feeling made an appearance in her heart at the worst of times. And it was often at times she was happiest and almost never made any sense. She was used to it though, and it meant nothing. She ignored it and pedaled to Diana who was enthusiastically waving her short, pale arms by the lamp post, shouting to her that she had exciting news.</p><p> </p><p>But Jayne already knew that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>

  <em> <b>Chapter Four: A Cryptic Suicide Letter</b> </em>
</p><p>

  <em> <b>November 8</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Valerie, Microphone on, please.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>[This letter is for you. A warning letter, that will probably come as a shock to you, but here it goes...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>A long time ago, in a holistic world no further than right here...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Life, had no meaning. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>No purpose, without hatred, violence, war and </em> <em>discrimination.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Though— as you mayght have similarly interpreted, a life </em>without<em> those purpose-propelling tools of bravery, meant a life without choice. And a life without choice, could be argued as impeccably worse than a rocked, free world of chaos. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>In fact, in order to especially realize what a very real, reality of chaos would really look like— a damning reality, thatn’t you may ever acknowledge again— you must first understand that </em>choice, <em>and </em><em>options</em>, <em>were</em> <em>inexplicably what drove your Terran human nature to sin. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>To sin, as in ways of </em>pride<em> and envy, propitiated, by an innate need for greed and a brewing rapture for wrath. And not only was your action to sin inevitable, and proven consistently throughout time... </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It was Politically Incorrect.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>A crime. </p><p> </p><p>Basically, your world was already on a steady path to extinction...</p><p> </p><p><em>And well, I won’t be a hypocrite, considering </em>we<em> destroyed our own world a long time ago. Which yes... that’s exactly what that means— we are not </em>from<em> where you are </em>from<em>. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Our remaining, survived-population had then been forced to become explorers, searching for decades by orbital arkship (for a place for our species to settle back down) before finally finding our new home.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes, our new home. And yours, currently. Earth.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Yes, when we discovered your G-class, star bound, habitable environment— in what was the Terran year of 1952– we voted, and collectively resorted to initiate a peaceful invasion. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>A very, very </em>slow<em>, political, peaceful invasion. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>We remained in your orbit, in hiding. Parked, here with purpose and enough radiation emulators to easily blind your satellites for as long as we wanted. Studying your culture by beam-blending in our expert biologists, psychologists and sociologists firsthand, supporting our hypotheses in which that we have nearly identical biological physiologies. And when we had collected enough data in 2001, we then phased to (peacefully) kidnap your babies (undetected by the present Terran culture obviously, as there were a significant amount of abandoned/motherless children for selection) to establish our own, replicated Terran culture, here on our own arkship.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>A simulation experiment one mayght call it. To further seclude our species safety and yours in this invasion. By studying you. Then modifying.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>A replica simulation of our interpretation of your way of life... though for your own species sake, we simply eliminated the elements your world that seemed to be the cause of your progressing destruction. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Then, once our incubate babies grew into the lovely young men and women we harvested them to be, we proceed to inform them of their true identities and beam-send them back down to their (our new) home planet to live out their destined, pre-chosen career. Our political purpose relies on building an army from within without any unnecessary warfare. No casualties. And we have successfully, already research-completed about three, human generation cycles. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>However, we have only reached an infiltration of about .009%.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Needless to say, this has become a sore subject on our societal ship, and the living population has grown comedically tired with this... politically safe “experiment”.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>This “experiment” began sixty “years” ago (by your planets “solar schedule”), and we have been stupidly spending all of our resources on this... replica— and virtually none of it on actually planning to move our seventy-five </em>million<em> people colony, down to Earth where they </em>rightfully<em> belong. Apparently, we have gotten “lost in the research”, as one mayght say from Earth? Forgetting its original purpose? I don’t know, I’ve just read the articles.</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Are we honestly waiting until the natural people of Earth die out and we become the greater ratio?  When will this invasion become violent? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Most likely when our politicians have grown old and new ones— worse ones take over. (If only you knew what this truly meant.)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>But anyway, enough about us— this letter was supposed to be about you. And me. Well, I guess more about your species, as a whole.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>Historically, we’ve learned that </em><em>human nature continuously strove for uniform perfection. A whitewashable control of the consensus, conveniently masked by an</em> <em>indivisibly fraudulent face. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>So then we created our base story of explanation (specifically for these babies, who were kept strictly unaware they never actually grew up on Earth.) Also designed, in hopes of maintaining Terran culture, whilst corrupting our own tweaks— we, as a worldwide community, created a “proposal”. A political outlet of taboo for their chaotic blame...</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>So here was the historical background, a fake proposition for our newly fixed, replicated, little Terran society. Which, I’m sure you remember, as you learned this to be true history your whole life. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>“What if you were to have all choice </em><em>taken</em> <em>away,” we asked ourselves, whilst market-proposing— “</em><em>but</em><em> simultaneously, still be promised protection over your individual freedom and equality?” </em></p><p> </p><p><em>An oxymoronic ploy, obviously?</em> <em>Well, not exactly.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Think about it. Imagine how</em><em> much pain could have been prevented in your life if there had been somebody to have chosen the smarter or better choice for you, first? How much time could have been saved? For living a happier life? What would there be left to </em><em>truly</em> <em>desire, if there were not any lingering, confusing options to idealize or misinterpret?”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Right... what a nice vision. </em> <em>But at what cost did this delusion accompany again? (My own personal opinion.)</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“What if you were to be watched and hyper-studied until the beginning mark of your Adulthood, and then hand-delivered your own, individualized, pre-designed, pre-packaged, ‘</em><em>Dream</em> <em>Life’</em>... <em>on a silver platter?”</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>And... that was it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>That was the manifesto. Simple. History.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>“The promised illusion of free will, safety and sanity all in exchange for the removal of world privacy...” And you were taught that most people bought</em> <em> </em> <em>the security willingly. ...Right, you’d learn about money later, along with your identity. But hopefully for you my friend, it won’t be in the way as systematically planned. “Regardless, this security was something you chose.”</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The security. The cameras, or more rather, our scientific lab lenses we use to watch you live.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>How</em> we<em> presently watch you live. The Life Officers... What a job.</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes, this part is real. The absolute, horrid truth.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>Well, actually, we’re not watching you live. Essentially, we mostly just watch you </em><em>exist..</em>. <em>Not</em> live. Not yet. <em>Yes</em>, <em>technically</em>, <em>were supposed to watch you </em><em>exist</em> <em>before</em><em> you </em>start<em> living your “real life”. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Your Dream Life.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>And obviously, we only watch your life because we </em>have<em> to watch your life. By force of law. Well, I’m forced to, at least. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The profession used to be a choice. Like your world’s militia. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Now, it was by law. Also... like your world’s militia.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>Essentially, we watch your existence through a lens-censored, looking glass. It’s my sacred window to your world— but... it’s broken. Rather, that it’s a </em>one<em>-way screen, I mean. To your telescopic, rose filtered reality. Which is an oxymoron, but </em>whatever<em>.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“We know what you like.” In this simulation you live in. “We know what you’re good at. We know your favorite food. We know your biggest irritations and triggers</em><em>... We know your social anxieties, your quirks, your latest Calculus exam results, your sexual orientation. We can detect your voice, in a crowd of five hundred. We know what’s </em><em>best</em> <em>for you. And</em><em> then, we put it together in the most comfortable package, so you can live a most comfortable life.” It’s what’s best.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>I, know what’s best... for </em>you. <em>Yes</em> you,<em> specifically. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Though you don’t even know me at all. And you never will. (In light of this message patently being intercepted before it’s intended arrival. But that’s another conversation.)  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>And so here I am, cemented on the other side of this ship, wasting away with a wasted purpose. Forced by law to utilize my “abilities” for the greater good. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Abilities... Because we’re more intelligent, obviously. That’s plainly known. Well, it’s a fact, actually, as scientifically— or rather genetically, we’re smarter than you... by about 76%. It’s our main biological difference. But that’s not my point.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>The point of this letter is that I simply just don’t believe my contribution to the “greater good” was meant for... </em>this<em>. I do not see the purpose of continuing this idiotic, passive infiltration when my generation, and more than likely— my </em>great<em>-grandchildren’s generation, are not even going to step foot on Earth. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>I</em><em> was </em>not<em> meant to baby monitor another human being— only to then shallowly spoon feed them their pointlessly, conflictless life, just for them to go on and live it without me. Living their Dream Life.</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“The Dream Life is a collective right of passage. And no, it is not like the outdated, once-upon-a-time, (heavily teased) picket-fence dream life. A life that long ago, one worked their whole lives for, only to be disappointed in the end.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>More rather, this was subtly referring to present life on Earth. To get you accustomed to how it really would be, down there.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Yes, this “Dream Life” is rightfully, your entitled, natural right— unanimously agreed that everyone borned, rightfully deserved. Everyone. Given the same, individualized opportunity, with an equal chance to succeed. Guaranteed.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>Sure... you mayght no longer have privacy now, </em><em>true</em> <em>. But on a global mortality scale, that was an easy sacrifice, right?</em></p><p> </p><p><em>No, I know, I'm joking. And I know that’s a little dark or mad, considering I’m talking to a computer at the moment... But I must apologize my dearest friend, because you think that you do, but you have </em>no<em> idea what real, authentic privacy is like at all. You </em>actually<em>, have no idea what </em>anything<em> authentic is like— </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“However, our true and very honest question is— was, that at the time before the worldwide ULC installations, there had been zero aforemention... zero pre-warranty, zero </em><em>warning</em><em>, zero </em>nothing<em>— of what </em>this<em> would really do to your world society.”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“And why not exactly? Why </em>did<em> nobody warn of the potentialities?”</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Or did they? And maybe, we just didn’t care to listen?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>All of the above are philosophical debates taken  straight out of your textbooks. It’s kind of sad. Mostly more subtle referrals to Earth. Okay it’s really sad, but your species’ obsession over race and sexuality are honestly the main variables in all of the sub-studies. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p><em>Apparently your culture is so fascinating and obscure to us, we felt the impulsive need to incorporate some poetic background. To some, I think they think it’s to make the reality reveal come as less of a shock, maybe? </em> <em>Honestly though, to me, it seems more like how overconfident serial killers feel the need to leave behind patterned clues. (An anthropologist unfortunately discovered we actually had this social defect in common.)</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Humanity stripped to its bone, surely overtime found something to </em>prejudice<em> in itself, of course. Because that was the only thing humanity had left to control. That’s my hypothesis at least. But what do I know? I’m only a nineteen year old, Si boy with a convert IQ of 267. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>So here’s my proposed threat. This— this fake, Terran humanity, since, had never acted violently upon the hand that fed it. And it would </em>continue<em> to never.</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>For now...</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>So was the sacrifice of choice, the key to world peace? Was that where our combined species was headed to evolve into? Can we even control a social evolution? </em><em>Or</em> <em>was</em> <em>that</em> <em>a</em> <em>senselessly, ill</em> <em>contradiction</em> <em>all</em> <em>on</em> <em>its own</em><em>? </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Although... ironically,</em> <em>it</em> <em>doesn’t</em> <em>really</em> <em>matter in the end</em>. For you and me?</p><p>  </p><p>This is my final goodbye to you. My only goodbye.</p><p> </p><p>All right, <em>see</em> <em>you</em> <em>on</em> <em>the</em> <em>other</em> <em>side</em>...</p><p> </p><p><em>Valerie</em>, <em>Send</em>.]</p><p> </p><p><em>Valerie</em>, <em>Microphone</em> <em>off</em> <em>please.</em></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>SIX MINUTES AGO...</p><p>_________________________________________</p><p>Dear Adult Resident #7251,</p><p>Your private-sent-message was recently flagged and intercepted by postal police.</p><p><em>RED</em> <em>FLAG:</em> <em>Channeled</em> <em>issue</em> <em>due</em> <em>to</em> <em>unauthorized</em> <em>message</em> <em>attempt</em>/<em>postal</em> <em>threat</em> <em>by</em> <em>editing</em> <em>officer</em> #<em>564</em>.</p><p>Adult Resident #7251 is hear-by summoned for a recommended court hearing on the date of 3/12/60.</p><p>A peace-warrant for your arrest is underway.</p><p>Stay where you are.</p><p>_________________________________________</p><p>_________________________________</p><p>[                      {Error!}                       ]</p><p>[   ———Message not delivered———     ]</p><p>_________________________________</p><p>_________________________________________</p><p>{Warning!&lt;#7251&gt;<em>output/</em><em>disconnection/redflaggedlocation</em>}</p><p>_________________________________________ </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Adult Resident #7251 was staring thoughtlessly across the dark of his room, when he finally squinted back at the blinding screen of his flagged, instant message.</p><p>Waiting...</p><p>He studied the words slightly, as the message blinked back at him slowly, like a pair of red lungs, breathing steadily on his screen. Taunting him.</p><p>Though this was exactly what he wanted. What he planned.</p><p>He sighed contently, closing his eyes. <em>This</em> <em>will</em> <em>work</em>, he told himself.</p><p><em>It</em> <em>will</em> <em>work</em>. <em>It</em> <em>has</em> <em>to</em> <em>work</em>. The plan was set. It had been set for nearly four months now. He was sure he had thought of everything.</p><p><em>But</em> <em>what</em> <em>if</em>... he hadn’t?</p><p>What was he saying— of course he had. And there was not any spare time for self-doubt now.</p><p>7251 stood up coolly in front of the glow of the monitor screen, as his shadowed, tall frame rose with him in the quiet of his quarters. The lonely, dark projection on the wall was truly haunting in the late of tonight’s circumstances.</p><p>The room was a small living space, but it fit him contently. The walls were usually a bright, warm shade of white— though that was with the florescents on. The light timer was <em>off</em>, now, and the walls surrounded him in a folded blur of blue shadows. Trapping him inside the grainy, plaster box, angled sharp with its perfectly square corners.</p><p>A consistent, dry smell of condensed heat and rusted furnace also occupyed the space, burning his nose and throat with every deep breath. There were no windows (because he was in the center of the complex). Routinely no sound at all, besides the quaking hum of the ventilation. Waxed, wood floors. A personalized kitchen, cotton bed, washroom and a computer-television. It was everything he needed.</p><p>He stepped back from his desk, as he pushed in his metal chair, just about halfway—meticulously angling it out thirty-five degrees. He reached over to move the sandalwood picture frame that was next to his computer-television— over, about a half of a centimeter.</p><p>He followed the plotted, procedure steps in his head. Checking them off. He took his school bag off of the wall hook and dropped it on the floor with a thud. He kicked it over slightly so it was in the middle of the walkway.</p><p><em>Check</em>.</p><p>Though, he unwontedly noticed that his breathing had fallen more shallow than usual, in this rare occasion. He actually could feel, in his chest, his heartbeat rising to about eighty-nine beats per minute, rather than his normal, resting rate of fifty-two. He walked (calmly) over to his gray-velvet couch and sat down on the center cushion. Then, he glanced down at his ticking, glass watch. </p><p><em>Nine</em> <em>more</em> <em>minutes</em>... </p><p>He missed his shift, so they were probably in even more of a hurry to arrest him. With obviously nothing better to do.</p><p>7251 reached across his cedarwood coffee table, knocking an old, binary Earth book onto the mahogany-paneled flooring and— he stopped first, bending down to flip the book over (so the cover was facing up. Purposefully showcasing the title and author, <em>Sense</em> <em>and</em> <em>Sensibility</em> <em>by</em> <em>A</em> <em>Lady</em>). Then, he grabbed the brown, paper bag that was resting on the edge of the table. —The unnervingly <em>loud</em>, paper bag.</p><p>Okay... Check. <em>Consequential</em>-<em>reactive</em> action number eight was set. Good.</p><p>He began to roll up the sleeve of his left arm, wrinkling the white polo fabric of his school uniform, and then emptied out the crinkled, paper bag’s contents onto the cushion next to him.</p><p>He cringed, as the crumpled-paper noise scratched noisily over the quiet of the room. Everything sounded too loud right now. But that was only his perception. <em>Nobody</em> <em>else’s</em>, he rationalized.</p><p>
  <em>That’s what happens when a person’s adrenaline spikes. Their senses cloud their logical judgement.</em>
</p><p>He scattered everything evenly. Every movement had a reason.</p><p>He stretched out the used, rubber band from the pile of paraphernalia, and then wrapped it twice, tight around his bare, left arm, right above his elbow. —It pinched the tiny hairs on his pale, mole-speckled skin, as he slid it up further, making his tight, bicep muscle involuntarily flex in spasm. He had worked out at the communal gym just a few hours earlier... but no, his muscles felt strange— shaky like.</p><p>Why was he suddenly nervous? He had never been nervous about anything in his entire life.</p><p>He sorted through, then selected from the pile, a small, square packet and ripped out an alcohol soaked towelette. Dropping the opened garbage on the floor.</p><p>Consequential-<em>perceptive</em> action number four was set. <em>Check</em>, seven minutes.</p><p>He was deliberate, precise and calm, as he directed the stage of his living quarters. Though, he imagined that watching himself now, it would seem as if he were more alone than ever, setting up his own suicide right in front of his television. He ignored his nerves (and his still, rising heartbeat), feeling with two fingertips, along the inside crease of his elbow, marking where his vein began to bulge slightly, wiping it clean with the alcohol towelette.</p><p>Finally, he zipped open the prepared, needle syringe from the sterilized plastic bag, and held it up under the dim, florescent light. And then flicked it once with his other finger, testing the clear, synthetic, opioid liquid.</p><p>He suppressed the insecure inquiry that was pestering his frontal lobe thinking at this very moment. An inquiry, which mayght or mayght not have relevance to his own inaccuracy in the vital, volume measurement and moiety of compound U-47700 and Fentanyl.</p><p>Stop it, he told himself.</p><p>He completely <em>dismissed</em> the nagging thought. The chemistry was simple?</p><p>He was just being irrationally uncertain. He was acting... like <em>her</em>.</p><p>All right. He looked at his watch again. Tuning his thoughts to the rhythm.</p><p>...<em>Tick... </em>tick... <em>tick... </em>tick... The reliable, measurable sound was always as comforting, as it was familiar to him. Like a heartbeat.</p><p>Although, <em>that</em> had proven to be inconsistent recently... Considering his heartbeat never irregulared. Even when he was lying. Which was discomforting to him, now on multiple levels. Self-doubt, being one of them. 7251 frowned on the inside.</p><p>Stop. <em>It</em>.</p><p>(By the way, “frowning-type actions” happened to 7251 on the <em>inside</em>, because he was, admittingly so, not entirely skilled at expressing his emotions on the outside. With his face... or body. In fact, he was terrible at it. Though, it never truly bothered him. Because the concept to him, was as foreign as it was irrelevant. And it did also mean that he was all the more impressive at hiding when he told a lie.) His emotions rose neutral again. That’s better.</p><p><em>Four</em> <em>more</em> <em>minutes</em>... He rationed he had a few moments of free time.</p><p>7251 scanned his apartment once more, as a final verification that everything was in place.</p><p>Then he stopped. His softening, directed vision pausing, at the fragile, sandalwood framed, photograph of Owun— or rather formally known, “Child Resident #56101”— that was on the very edge of his computer desk. 56101 was 7251’s individuate brother by choice.</p><p>His responsibility.</p><p>He visually took in the reassuring, frozen image of his warm, brown eyes... and his freckled, little cheeks, as they smiled back at him innocently. About to watch him do what he was about to do. </p><p><em>This</em> <em>was</em> <em>going</em> <em>to</em> <em>work</em>.</p><p>He thought once more of him and then lastly of her, as he carefully inserted the needle into his vein with calculation, then consciously pressed his thumb down on the syringe, pushing in the toxic chemical.</p><p>And— then he felt it go in, icy-cool and sharp, spreading up his arm, entering into his bloodstream. And he strangely even, briefly <em>tasted</em> the sweet bitterness in his mouth, before he felt anything more than sensory in his mind.</p><p>Then he waited for the numbness.</p><p>Gradually relaxing back his head, it was only moments later, when he felt the velvety, couch fabric begin to go dull and tingly against the pads of his fingers, as his thoughts and skin went numb.</p><p>So it was a warm blur, by the time his eyes only fluttered, upon hearing the door bang. Right on schedule.</p><p>”<em>Resident</em> <em>7251</em>, open up,” a deep voice rehearsed from outside his locked, metal door. They knocked again.</p><p>“Open up, or we will use force.”</p><p>No response from him on cue. <em>They cant come in. </em>He smirked pompously on the inside.<em> They can’t come in until they’ve stated aloud what the law mandates</em>. </p><p>It was surely due to the drug, but he was reassuringly feeling much more like his usual jaded, cynical self. </p><p>He half-listened to them bang harder and louder and then count down from ten, as he started to drift off.</p><p>“...Nine—” he then, heard one officer chuckle randomly from the outside, (7251 thought he had accounted for all extraneous error and variables, but this particular lot of amateurs wasted a <em>lot</em> of uncalculated time) “...<em>Eight</em> ...<em>Sev</em>—”</p><p><em>Seven..</em>. Ha. What poetry.</p><p>”...five... four... three... two... one—“</p><p>His mind had now gone spotty, though he was still clearly picturing <em>them— </em>as he tumbled, deeper down the swallowing, rabbit hole. It was ironic. Of all the things, that was what he lastly saw. Was him... And <em>her</em>. How <em>irrational</em>.</p><p>”—Resident 7251, take precaution— we are coming in.”</p><p>His lifeless body continued sinking deeper and deeper into the couch, as they performed their final verse from the other side, “A warrant for your arrest orders you to cooperate in exchange for a negotiable sentence.”</p><p><em>Cooperation... </em>he smiled faintly, on the inside, of course.</p><p><em>He was the</em> <em>light</em> <em>of</em> <em>cooperation</em>.</p><p><em>He</em> <em>basically</em> <em>did</em> <em>their</em> <em>duties</em> <em>for</em> <em>them?</em></p><p><em>Three</em>, <em>two... one........ one and a half... </em></p><p>—not <em>yet</em>... he winced, hating when he miscounted— three, two—</p><p>With one last, big bang at the door, it was his own ringing ears that had barely even heard the framed, glass photograph crash loudly onto the wooden floor. But he heard it, all right.</p><p>
  <em>Check.</em>
</p><p>Then he heard the door gate bar, as it slid unlocked, instantly in response to the crash.</p><p>
  <em>He was in control...</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Idiots.</em>
</p><p>And by the time that they all barged in, setting up into their ridiculously unnecessary, guard-posed defense— Resident #7251 was— as planned... almost dead. </p><p>Which would then, consequently, now set everyone else on course to... well, figure out the rest.</p><p>He had wholeheartedly hoped.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

  <em> <b>Chapter Five: Campus Level One</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>Friday, 7:29 AM</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>June 16th</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Diana hands Jayne letter of acceptance to College Academy: Campus Level One. </p><p>They are excited to be in the same College Campus together. (There are ten campuses, usually sorted by intellect.)</p><p>Leave for school on their bikes and Diana takes two of Jayne’s heavy books, (showing she is compassionate.)</p><p>Description if Pinecone-Paeonia as they ride. Mention the Backyard woods that their houses are circled around. A couple drone cameras pass them.</p><p>Brief mention of Samuel not doing well in school, that his mother has been tutoring him in the mornings. Jayne says her mother is frustrated because Samuel is very smart and she thinks he is experimenting and failing on purpose. Jayne doesn’t know why.</p><p>Arrive at school. Talk to Mr. Gellert. (German, tough looking man with kind eyes.) He congratulates their graduation and success of campus level one. (He also went to campus level one.)</p><p>Class begins. Mention of Adam who sits next to Jayne and says hi. Mention of Johanna who makes fun of Diana for not having gotten her letter yet. Jayne jumps in and defends her by saying she got it today and also got in to campus level one. (Jayne, Johanna, Diana, Adam and a boy named Victor were the only ones who got into level one. Most towns don’t get any, but Jayne boasts that it is all because of Mr. Gellert’s hard work and attention.)</p><p>In class, they go over their essays and then Mr. Gellert says for the rest of class they will be going over summer college preparation. And that he will explain what to expect on the first couple of days. (If you are playing a fall sport, you will be given notice within the month and you must show up earlier than orientation.)</p><p>Orientation: you will take the train to your college campus. Meet as freshmen class in the football stadium. Then you will be called for and handed your assignments of: your SETBEAM major and meet your cohorts (Science and medicine, Engineering, Technology and computer mechanics, Business and law, Education, Arts, and Maintence/other.)</p><p>Then you will be assigned your building and Roommate.</p><p>Your belongings will already be dropped off and you will head straight there and go to sleep.</p><p>And then you will report the next day to your SETBEAM guide for your schedule of classes, extra curricular activities and clubs, and he or she will give you a tour of campus. He mentions that at college there are less cameras and to not be alarmed because you are still safe.</p><p>You will be given your life mate last and some of you will be on the waiting list. But things all get sorted out eventually.</p><p>Skips to the end of the day where Mr. Gellert congratulates everyone and says he will see everyone at the grad ceremony. </p><p>Jayne looks in her desk and sees a wrapped gift from Mr. Gellert. There was a note to her name and from his name at the bottom. </p><p>Shes about to open it when Johanna stops her and secretly tells her to open it in CDT later.</p><p>This confuses Jayne because Johanna has never spoken to her in that way. But she got the idea. She knew what it was.</p><p>Jayne thinks about the time she thanked Mr. Gellert for Pride and Predjudice and he pretended like he had no idea what she was talking about. Which was to keep her safe. Why would Johanna want to keep her safe? </p><p>She opens it at home in CDT and the cover is colorful like pride and predjudice. The title reads, “Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell.” Inside the cover reads in stamped-typed font,</p><p>“Jayne,</p><p>Congratulations on campus level one.</p><p>Here’s a special book I think you should read before leaving.</p><p>Notice anything familiar?</p><p>Do not show this to anyone.”</p><p>Then under it was a signature stamp that read, “Serial-code#3654432s7251”</p><p> </p>

  <em> <b>Sunday, 15:30</b> </em>

  <em> <b>April 30th</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>7251 (aka Sev— we finally hear his nick name, as somebody calls him that before he walks into the courthouse and wishes him luck) Sev has a court date meeting detailed about a change in his reassignment.</p><p>In January, he originally (it is restated aloud in court) was dropped of his OSP case (Jayne) for convicted postal and drug treason and reassigned for next year to be a Si Guard in the criminal plantation.</p><p>But now he has been called back on for a recall trial due to further investigation. They have claimed to have concluded his “suicide attempt” to be false. They have discovered his brother-like/guardian relationship with hall neighbor Owun (boy from picture frame) to be a prime motive— whom has since been detained in the past year as a “failed” Si, recognized as lacking the gene’s proper qualities of intellect and was sentenced to the criminal plantation. </p><p>They believe Seven’s suicide attempt to be superficial and poorly executed. He used an alcoholic wipe, as an unnecessary precaution, which they ruled as another clue— and irrational, if he was just planning on killing himself. </p><p>They ask for his statement and he pretends to be annoyed/angry, saying no comment. (Ruled as pleading guilty/confession of manipulated treason.) The judge admires his bravery aloud but factors in his stupidity being reasoned to him making a decision using emotions and not logic. He reminds him that he cannot choose his path of societal duty based upon a trivial relationship. Especially with a (non-Si) boy. The judge is especially easy on him and it makes the reader suspicious.</p><p>The judge mandates his Scholarship award for exemplary academic scores to be revoked. (Which was to be a 6 year study-retirement break, then to work as a professor on campus 3.) but he is however, to continue his original line of duty.</p><p>He pleads why they don’t send him to assist in criminal reassignment on Earth? Try him as a non-Si and send him down there with the others. Or just lock him up?</p><p>They say they admittingly do not trust his current plea and believe he wishes to go down to Earth (condescendingly).  They believe him to be in a rebellious phase that he will eventually grow out of. That there are more important matters of the future than his childlike treason today. The potential greater good outweighs his immaturity.</p><p>Seven then says why is this not true for everyone else? Or for non-Si?</p><p>It is then basically verbalized that his extremely high IQ and intellect of abilities is too valuable to misuse even though he had violated the law through postal and drug treason. This is another stated reason he will not be working as a guard with criminal reassignment. [Quiet metaphorical nod to white/ male privilege.]</p><p>*later in a few chapters it is brought up how it is known that scholarships cannot be declined upon declaration. Students must go if they are awarded scholarship.</p><p>The judge orders him back on to his ordinary schedule to infiltrate as an Si undercover campus Officer with his OSP and cohort on campus level 1. But he is on probation and under restraining order from social activity until further notice.</p><p>*also mentions later how campus officers are under strict law of confidentiality. </p><p>Seven makes his frustration visible, but we have insight to his thoughts which was that this was obviously his plan all along. </p>

  <em> <b> </b> </em>
</p><p>Jayne, Diana, Samuel, and Diana’s younger sister Olivia are at the movies. The movie being played is Back to the Future. (Which has her favorite phillipino actor in it, James Ryan Valentino.)</p><p>The movie ends, and they talk about it as they leave. They imagine how cool it would be if they had a flying car that could time travel. Just to see how scary life used to be in the past when their was no safety guarantee on your life. They imagine just having a car at all. Then Jayne asks what they think it would be like if old people didn’t have to move away into retirement homes after their children go to college. (Because Doc Brown escapes their town’s Retirement home to find Marty, but is eventually arrested and brought back in the end.) (doc brown is also described as handsome and their parents age, like 50s. Basically showing that they are unaware that the term “old people” has changed and that they do not actually know what true elderly people look like. A drone visibly and audibly shows up so they instantly change the subject.</p><p>On bike ride home, it’s dark out with street lamps leading them with a couple drones spaced evenly far alongside the road. When the drones leave, Olivia brings up about how they saw on the news at the movies that there were two arrests in Rose-Blossom. They know who the one was. It was Diana and Olivia’s cousin April. They knew this already because their mother told them and said it was because she was going to shoplift medicine.</p><p>Jayne wonders why she would have needed to steal something that wasn’t already prescribed to her or on her Individual Medication Plan.</p><p>Diana says that’s wrong but she feels bad for her family. Jayne asks well why did she need the medicine? Olivia says does that matter? She was going to steal. Jayne said she doesn’t think it’s fair for a person to go to the Plantation for Criminals with other criminals who have done far worse crimes. To which Diana argues “What do you mean? What’s worse mean when all criminals are breaking the law?”</p><p>Jayne says she doesn’t know actually. Then she thinks about the book Mr. Gellert gave her and the words inside she had never seen before. Well, she knew what it meant. But she had never seen it written... Meanwhile, Samuel had kept oddly quiet during the entire conversation and Jayne was thankful. Afraid he might have said something controversial enough for Olivia to tell her mother. And that Diana would never do that.</p><p>They part ways and Samuel and Jayne walk for a little while off of their bikes. He asks her about college and jokes if she’s going to survive without him. She laughs and tells him she’ll be fine and see him soon enough. Then they soon notice a drone hover following behind them.</p><p>Then another moves closer to them. Jayne and Samuel look at each other confused. They reach the end of the road and Jayne is becoming paranoid as a sixth drone arrives— still following them.</p><p>She asks Sam what’s going on? Something must be wrong. They think it might be their mother and father, so they hop back on their bikes. They stop suddenly now with a view of the police car parked near their house. They rush inside dropping their bikes. The police car only showed up for serious situations. Neighbors are nosily all standing outside their houses in bathrobes.</p><p>She anxiously thinks it might be about the book she got. Her new book. Which was nothing like Pride and Prejudice.. (It was the second gift she received from Mr. Gellert. The novel 1984, which again had an illustrated cover and the author’s name George Orwell. She had only got halfway until it started to scare her. There were words in it that she knew were about “hurting someone on purpose until they die” and cameras that watched them just like the ones here except someone Bad was watching them. It was not a pleasant story. It hasn’t moved from being hidden in her dresser drawer since. She hadn’t visited Mr. Gellert all summer, which she usually did at least twice— to show him a short story she wrote, or a new book she finally got to read. She eventually told Diana in CDT about the book— which scared her as well because... She said she got one too, Fahrenheit 451– and had torn it up before she even read a page. She had been throwing out a couple pages a day so no one would notice. She told Jayne she should do the same. Jayne didn’t.)</p><p>Her mother and father were already downstairs and looked terribly worried talking to two police officers. Jayne yells to them “mother what’s going on?”</p><p>she hurries over to them and Samuel stops as the police officers start walking towards him. Their mother tells Jayne to go upstairs.</p><p>(The Officers take out handcuffs and start reading his Miranda Rights as Jayne and her mother in shock and panic. Jayne yells confused “what’s happening?” as they begin to arrest Samuel.</p><p>Their mother demands to know why from Samuel (she almost looks angry at him) and begs the officers that he did nothing wrong. Sam is compliant and non-responsive as their mother begs him to say something. The officers say they were given a name and an order and are not authorized to give such information and they will find out tomorrow in the newspaper. They say he is either a danger to society or himself.)</p><p>Jayne, completely bewildered now bargains thoughtlessly, begging the police officer to take her instead (as she has an internal monolougue, believing there must be a mistake and they meant to come for her not Sam) and that enraged her father that she would say something so stupid, grabbing her immediately. She stutters out again “it wasn’t him, it couldn’t be” but still she does not explicitly confess about her books. The officers say “little girl, don’t use words you shouldn’t” and Jayne’s father covers Jayne’s mouth, carrying her out of the living room as she muffles screaming “no let me go.” He tells her to go to her room and that this is a matter for the adults, she should have never spoken such treason and she’s lucky they didn’t take her too on the spot. Jayne answers instantly and says but I am an adult now. To which her father laughs and tells her she is not.</p><p>She tries to see down the hall past him what the officers were doing but then gives up sadly when she sees Sam being fully handcuffed. He doesn’t say anything but he looks right back at her and his expression tells her it’s okay.</p><p>She turns around and goes up to her room still in a panic trying to think of something and closes the door. Trying to sort everything out. She paces past her bed saying that it is her fault and opens her drawer to see the books are still there. She’s even more confused, even though she didn’t really expect them to be gone. She had gotten away with one stolen book all this time, why now at two? Maybe this second book is Bad. But nobody saw it? She realizes how naively irrational she was being. Nothing made sense! There was no consistency to judge upon the law! She closes the drawer back up then goes over to the window. She shuts off her lamp so she could see out into the dark.</p><p>He was down below, as her window view was from the second floor but she could still see him clearly. Their front yard light, a spotlight on him. She watches Samuel duck into the police car with his hands behind his back. Bongo escapes the house and stops in front of the car. Wondering where Sam was going.</p><p>Then, Jayne sees it. The moment that changed her opinion on everything. On him, on life, on what’s important and what’s right and wrong.</p><p>In that split moment, she actually saw Sam smirk. The tiniest smirk but definitely a Samuel smirk. She knew his looks and she saw the smirk flash all the way up to his eyes. </p><p>Why?</p><p>The officers finish writing something on a pad then go into the car, shutting their doors.</p><p>Jayne tries to squint and see Sam in the back but she can’t see him anymore. She absently watches the red and blue lights as she tries to understand the feeling inside of her. She stares until the police car engine starts and they begin to drive away with Samuel in the backseat and her parents hugging by the sidewalk.</p><p>Jayne stares out the window, now looking less concerned and more newly apathetic.</p><p>Of course he meant what he told her. He wanted to know what else was out there. She didn’t think he was looking for attention saying something like that? She knew he was serious. But she didn’t think he would <em>actually</em> do it. Oh, why didn’t she say something more to him? Why did she stop asking for their weekly talks? She had been so superficially occupied about leaving for school she didn’t even have time to think about Sam. She begins to tear up as the guilt sets in, before she hears her parents come back inside. Her mother was still crying. Tears angrily fall quietly down Jaynes cheeks.</p><p>Why would Sam do something like this? How could he do this to his family? To her? He knew better and what this does to a family and he did it anyway. She would never see him again and the last memory of him was the image of him— smiling!</p><p>Jayne changed into her pajamas growing angrier by the minute. She crawled into bed, suddenly feeling completely betrayed and cried herself silently to sleep.</p><p>Her parents never even checked on her.</p>

  <em> <b>Chapter Eight: Train of Thought</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>Tuesday, 8:47 AM</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>August 21st</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Five days later, Jayne is at the train station with her parents. She is not happy. She told them numerous times she did not want to go because of Samuel. They told her she had no choice.</p><p>She finds Diana and sits with her. They are quiet and Jayne sees her parents wave once more to her through the window. She closes the curtain. Diana asks if she wants to talk about it, which Jayne says no. Diana points out that at least he is 17 and will be still with the minors. He has a whole year before he moves to the other side of the Plantation.  Jayne just nods.</p><p>She thinks about what he was accused of. The news revealed two arrests were made that night. The one boy was for attempted emancipation. The second boy was for attempted emancipation. Attempted emancipation. He was planning on running away. With who? To where? Jayne didn’t know. She didn’t know him at all apparently.</p><p>Johanna opens the door, looking for an empty cart— but upon seeing the two of them, she then rolls her eyes, shutting it. </p><p>Jayne tells Diana that she noticed there were no cameras in their cart. Diana says that Mr. Gellert said that but she didn’t think it would be true so soon. This oddly makes Jayne feel a little bit better but then she feels guilty again, wondering where Sam even is right now. If her parents would re-do his room by the time she came home for Christmas Break. If they were going to pretend like it never happened and that things could be like they were. The idea makes her angry.</p><p>Diana asks Jayne what part of SETBEAM she thinks she’ll be assigned to. Jayne shrugs and Diana says she thinks Jayne will end up in Education like her mother. Diana thinks she will end up in Maintenance/other because she had gotten her letter so late. Jayne immediately shifts her mood to comfort her saying no you won’t, that is for the ones they don’t know what to do with, and you have so much to offer Diana. Diana thanks her but then jumps as—</p><p>Suddenly the door slides open, and a large, friendly boy with extremely dark skin asks if he could sit with them. They say sure. He checks down the aisle quickly and closes the door.</p><p>He had a lollipop in the side of his mouth and just smiles at them for a moment. He takes it out and says his name is Thomas. But people call him “Tooth.” He says he is the only one from his town going to Campus Level One and he doesn’t really know anyone. Jayne likes him already and tells him they don’t really know anyone either. </p><p>He reminds Jayne of Timothy but then she feels bad for thinking that. Even though they have similarly warm personalities, they are both the same skin color, so that would be wrong to assimilate them together. Jayne asks where he’s from and he says Olive-Wood. To which Jayne clarifies, “no which country?” which confuses him and then tells her oh, my family was from Ghana. He asks if they want some candy and that he ordered a ton. He wasn’t allowed to do that at home but here he can— and that kind of way of thinking just dawned on Jayne. They both say no thank you but are shocked when the door flies open again to an angry thin girl with light olive skin and black lipstick. Probably from South America, Jayne thinks. The girl looks at a loss for words then suddenly yells at Tooth saying are you mad? What the hell are you doing? To which he just laughs saying I was waiting for one of you to notice. It’s not a big deal. I just wanted to network a little.”</p><p>She glares at him “You’re unreal.” And then they both leave without even saying goodbye. She reprimands him again saying “you’re going to ruin everything, for what? A joke? You’re not funny.”</p><p>Jayne and Diana were totally lost. Jayne felt betrayed in a somewhat, strange way like Tooth was using them in a way. Like making fun of them? She takes it back. He did not remind her of Timothy. Diana was more preoccupied with the fact that the girl said the word “hell.” She says she thinks it’s a bad word.</p><p>Jayne says out loud to Diana that clearly they were not in Pinecone-Paeonia anymore.</p>

</p><p>
  <em> <b>August 21st</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Get off the train and follow the crowd to the football stadium. Except the stadium is about 30 times bigger than her towns and Diana tells Jayne she feels afraid, which makes Jayne laugh. </p><p>The Dean welcomes everyone and then begins calling names to collect their SETBEAM and roommate package.</p><p>Jayne sees Johanna go and get Business and law, which Jayne thought was honestly appropriate. Then a few more go and she watches all of the other Indians on stage and feels uncomfortably empowered. She notices one Indian boy with blue hair named Theodore who gets assigned Tech and computer mech and knows she wants to be his friend. Diana gets called up and gets announced she’s assigned Education, which she seemed thrilled about.</p><p>Then she sees Tooth get called up and be assigned Engineering. He still had a lollipop in his mouth. People cheered. Then the mean girl that yelled at him with the black lipstick gets assigned Arts. Her name was Honey.</p><p>Finally Jayne gets called up and gets assigned maintence/other. She is very upset. She sees her roommate is Noora Persephone Perssen, which she thought was an odd way to spell Nora. This made Jayne feel a little better, that maybe she was a little different.</p><p>Half of the stadium was gone by the time she left for her building (Building 6, floor 19) and she gets there to meet a beautiful girl who Jayne was instantly jealous of, but then gets angry at herself for thinking in such a way. She was pale with pale blonde hair and pale blue eyes. She wore red lipstick and brightened immediately as Jayne walked in. Their room was huge and they had a beautiful birds eye view of the campus. Jayne could tell right away she liked Noora. She seemed very kind. She told her she was from Orange-Tree. And she was assigned in maintenance/other too. Jayne was infinitely relieved to hear she wasn’t going to be in that group alone. </p><p>After unpacking Jayne fell asleep in her new bed which the most perfect, comfortable bed she thinks she could have been given. She almost feels happy for a moment until she thinks about Samuel again.</p><p> </p>

</p><p>
  <em> <b>Wednesday, 5:00</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>August 22nd</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Sam wakes up to a loud siren of an alarm in a cold cell bunker. It’s small and only enough room for him and another person.</p><p>His roommate hops down from the bunk above him. </p><p>Its Adam. (Now understood to be the other person arrested that same day as Sam)</p><p>He says good morning and Sam just groans.</p><p>They change into their blue jumpsuits and dump their laundry down the chute. </p><p>A guard stops at their gate and opens their cell with a key card swipe, then keeps moving. Sam and Adam step out and into a line of randomly aged kids walking like a trained army.</p><p>Sam asks Adam about his birthday cut off again and how long he has until he has to move to the adult plantation facility. Adam says about 5 months.</p><p> </p><p>They walk through an entire arena as some kids veer off into their assigned sections and then Sam and Adam exit out, though still following the line.</p><p>They finally reach a section that says “Bus 5” on a sign and get in that line.  (Sam and Adam have been having a conversation this whole time/ not into detail about what yet) and then on the siren speaker a computer voice calls “Bus 1”. Then that line moves and heads outside of the arena.</p><p>Then finally call bus 5, and they walk in the line to go outside. It does not look like college or Pinecone paeonia at all. It is gray and foggy and rainy out. They go out to the sidewalk and there’s a blue bus waiting in the street that says “London transportation.”</p><p>sam and Adam get on the bus (they argue about something, making the reader unsure of their relationship before they became cell mates). They talk about how they aren’t allowed to converse about anything personal when they get to work and how that is strictly threatened with cell gas termination. They knew they were somewhere they didn’t exactly understand. They talk about how they woke up 2 days ago in their cell and have no memory of how they got there since their arrest.</p><p>They talk about the job they are forced to work at that they were heading towards (that dropped off four others with them that were also going to london) There job they describe to be a gigantic warehouse of printing press and workers handling machinery. The Si officer guard walks down the line on the bus calling names. Sam and Adam put on their gloves. Then then officer yells out for “Jeevan.” “Your custom worker gear.” And he throws him new goggles and a jacket with a check mark on it. It was different than Adams who got one with an “@“ on it. It was strange they worked at a job that required different uniforms for each individual worker (obviously the reader deciphers that to be casual work attire.)</p><p>After the officer leaves, a little boy with brown hair squeezes into Sam and Adams bus seat and says “Hi. Jeevan? Is that your last name?”</p><p>”Yeah?”</p><p>He seems shocked. ”...Do you know a Jayne Jeevan?” The little boys incredibly hopeful expression made Sam even more suspicious.</p><p>Sam says, “Yes... that’s my sister... why. Who are you?”</p><p>“Ohhh... wow.” He says slowly, looking oddly sentimental. Like he were thinking about something else. “And oh no, it’s nothing, I just think that my brother knew her, that’s all.” He puts out a hand, now smiling, “I’m Owen. We work at the same stop. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>”Sam.” He shakes his hand then turns to look at Adam with a squint of confusion.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Jayne wakes up early to Noora making scrambled eggs. She gives her a plate and Jayne is surprised saying she doesn’t really know how to cook, which Noora says it’s easy. And Jayne says she knows.</p><p>They head down to orientation for their tour and to receive their schedule package. A dark skinned girl with buzzed hair and unique earrings announces their names and that she will be giving them their tour. </p><p>Jayne gets hers and sees that she is following a class schedule to become a “mail post editor”. She doesn’t really even understand what that is. Noora also received a similar class schedule to be a mail post editor and Jayne was so relieved.</p><p>Jayne was in no extra curricular clubs... it was just her classes, and that was it. Noora was also placed in a women empowerment club and a cooking club. Jayne was mad because why couldn’t she join those clubs if she wanted to? Because she wasn’t “supposed” to, probably.</p><p>She also gets assigned her life mate and opens up the notice. Noora didn’t want to open hers yet.</p><p>Jayne was assigned to a boy name Theodore Kapoor. She remembered ha name and that he was the boy with the blue hair! She was actually happy, but at the same time she was a little disappointed. She hadn’t really thought about how to find him. </p><p>They go on the tour and Jayne notices barely any stationary cameras or drones around. They pass by food stores, the infirmary, the other dormitory buildings, the Bar, the Library and then finally the mailroom where they were all to be working.</p><p>Jayne is unhappy with it aesthetically. It was a gigantic cement room in the campus basement with poor lighting, no windows and empty walls. The ceiling was probably a hundred feet high, with stacked filing cabinets everywhere and hundreds and hundreds- thousands, of individual mailbox storage spaces. Filled with organized papers and more filing cabinets. Then, she turns around to look up at the levels and levels and levels of rows of computers. No one looks excited.</p><p> </p>

  <em> <b>Chapter Twelve: Teddy Kapoor</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>Friday, 2:38 PM</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>August 24th</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Jayne has class all day with Noora. She brings up to her that she needs to open her letter eventually. Noora doesn’t want to talk about it.</p><p>They have their essential skill classes on Friday (which is mixed in with all majors) This math class was also a social studies combination elective (The History of Finance) so Jayne was a little more intrigued that it wasn’t only a boring math class. Jayne was okay at math and thought it was easy, she just thought it was most especially boring. Okay, that being said, maybe she did have trouble sometimes.</p><p>Noora and Jayne walk in together and sit next to each other at a two person table in the middle facing the front. Then next walks in the boy with the blue hair—</p><p>Theodore was in this class. Jayne knew he didn’t know who she was yet. Noora asks if she’s going to talk to him and Jayne says not yet. Noora says she’ll open her letter if Jayne goes to talk to him. More students pile in.</p><p>Jayne considers the offer, but it’s too late anyway because the professor walks in. Everyone quiets down as he introduces himself and gives a brief outline of the class. Then he calls attendance.</p><p>As soon as he calls her name, Theodore turns around shamelessly in recognition. His expression didn’t seem fitting for how he should be judging Jayne. He looked skeptical. Jayne looked away instantly. She suddenly became self conscious and so hyper aware of everything that she couldn’t even concentrate for the rest of the class.</p><p>Theodore walked up to her and Noora after class. He introduced himself as Teddy and asked if she was really Jane.</p><p>Noora gave them privacy. But that suddenly made Jayne the most shy, insecure, unconfident person ever. She couldn’t believe how unbrave she was being. Jayne was never scared of anything, but right now she couldn’t even look at this person.</p><p>He proceeded to ask her about where she was from, her family and what her career was. Jayne was a bit overwhelmed and just stared at him. He was very nice... but he was more noticeably, a little... quirky. Strange. Like he didn’t care what anyone thought of him in any kind of way, but he also didn’t exactly realize that he was a little odd. He seemed very socially oblivious. He even told her to relax and that he was “nervous” too. He said he was unsure about all of his assignments.</p><p>She still could barely look at him when he talked and she almost felt sick. He just kept talking and she had barely said one word. She was intimidated— that’s what it was.</p><p>He asked if she wanted to go to the Football game Tuesday night and that it should be a lot of fun. She said okay, but if Noora could come too, her roommate. He excitedly said sure, and to meet him and his friends at the Bar beforehand. (There were 15 centers in the Bar, as it was ridiculously, nearly 300 acres of space. And it was all indoors, but some levels were simulated <em>like</em> you were outdoors.) So he clarified to meet at the Sports Center. Then he went on to describe the others. (The 15 centers to choose from in the Bar were in elevator level order: Floor 1. Sports, Floor 2. Retro Rock, Floor 3. Retro Dance, Floor 4. Arcade and Game, Floor 5. Dive and Appetizer Trivia, Floor 6. Comedy, Poetry, and Acoustic Club, Floor 7. (Outdoor) Country Concert Deck, Floor 8. Fraternity and Sorority Only, Floor 9. DJ Club and Dance, Floor 10. (Outdoor) Beach Cabana, Floor 11. Rollerblade Derby and Bowling, Floor 12. (Outdoor) Electronic Neon Forest, Floor 13. (Outdoor/Indoor) Immersive Television Escape Room, Floor 14. (Outdoor) Carnival Rides and Boardwalk, and 15. (Outdoor) Canoe, Hammock and Rooftop Lights.)</p><p>Teddy said he was so excited to try everything, which got Jayne excited too. She felt a little more relaxed with him, but not really. She also thought about what it would be like to really drink alcohol.</p><p>She remembered the time she had a sip of alcohol with Samuel in CDT. She didn’t really understand what the hype was.</p><p>She told Noora later about the game and then said that she would tell Diana to come as well. She also told her that she would like her to not leave her alone with Teddy again unless she says it’s okay. Noora was surprised and said she was sorry and thought Jayne would be excited to meet him. Jayne said she thought so too.</p>

</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Seven is in his single dorm, laying flat in his bed staring at the ceiling. Then the door knocks and he checks to see who it is, then opens it.</p><p>He says, “where have you been?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> I made dinner.”</span></p><p>We have access to his thoughts and he refers to him as his best friend named Wells. Wells comes in and says “I was at the library. And sorry I grabbed a sandwich from pod truck.”</p><p>“Okay then why are you here?”</p><p>Wells asks looking surprised, “So... Tooth says you are going to go to the game tomorrow night?”</p><p>Seven laughs “Tooth is mistaken. I have more important things to do.”</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">Wells looks at him frankly. Then asks, “like what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">He says, “Like studying. Then I’m going to the gym.”</span>
</p><p>“Studying?” Wells says in disbelief, “Okay is this actually about the social probation? Cause I can’t imagine you following protocol. We’re here on your mission. Not to follow school rules.”</p><p>Sev says “I know that.” He looks a bit torn. “Unlike you, I don’t mind learning? And I don’t care about the probation, I just don’t want to go to the first football game of the year. Think how fucking irritating everyone will be who lived in variable dry-towns? They’ve literally never had alcohol before?”</p><p>Wells says “true. Like your girl, right?” Then he grows a smirk, “But I think what you really mean, is that you’re afraid of seeing her in person.”</p><p>Seven rolls his eyes and says get out.</p><p>Wells huffs a laugh, “Dude who cares? We’ve all got one, you’re not alone? I saw Johanna the other day and nearly shit myself. But it was all chill. This was your idea anyway.”</p><p>Sev first rolls his eyes again, “you sound like an idiot. Why are you talking like that?”</p><p>Wells chuckles, “college hand guide for most common variable town teen language.” He laughs “paeonia was obviously excluded from that. But I kinda like it? It has a fun flow to it.”</p><p>“It sounds ridiculous.” Then he defends himself from before “ and I know this was my idea but that’s exactly it— I told you when we would set it up. They’re not ready yet. This is too new for them to process anything more than what they’ve got in front of them first.”</p><p>“Or <em>you’re</em> not ready yet? You’re much better at seeing than I am but even I can see this path has zero interference. It’s just a football game.”</p><p>“Okay.” He stops short and fed up with him, “How about, I just don’t feel like going. Is that what you want me to say?”</p><p>“Yes.” Wells smirks satisfied. “And also that this plan wasn’t all for Owun. It was more about her.”</p><p>”Goodbye.” Seven says flatly, opening the door for him. “And your wrong. This is for all of us. Not them.”</p><p>“I’m just kidding, bro chill—” Wells chuckles while leaving. Then he stops to look at him seriously. “Okay fine, bye then, loner. Have fun hiding.”</p><p>Seven stares back at the door blankly as it slams shut. He secretly hated that Wells could always read him so well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

  <u> <em>Jayne</em> </u>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em><b>Chapter Fourteen: School Spirits</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>Tuesday, 6:38 PM</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>August 27th</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>It’s evening and Jayne was walking with Diana and Noora to the bar. They were dressed in their college campus level one colors. Level one was orange, then 2 was maroon, level 3 was brown... etc describe ivy colors. Their mascot was a tiger. Noora was wearing tiger ears and red lipstick which Jayne thought was brilliant. </p><p>Diana starts talking about how she was waitlisted for a life mate and is worried because she hasn’t met another person yet who also was waitlisted. Jayne says well Noora could be too, because she hasn’t even opened her envelope yet. Diana laughs and says that was actually a smart idea. Jayne says well atleast you weren’t assigned to the weirdest person on the planet. The other girls say aw give him a chance. Jayne says that he said to meet him and his friends by the 42nd tv spot and that his friend signed up to reserve ahead of time. Then she thinks about her brother again and feels guilty that she is here worrying about such trivial matters like socializing, a boy and her career. When Samuel’s well being was literally unknown.</p><p>They reach the Bar which was the biggest building Jayne he seen yet. They go in to the elevator then press 1. They reach the first floor and find Teddy was already in there with his friends. They were dressed in orange too. Today was the first game of the year and they were playing level 6. Jayne thinks she hadn’t properly noticed the first time but that despite the blue hair, she thought Teddy was very handsome. He sees her immediately and comes out from their section to show them over. Jayne Noora and Diana show their town resident license to enter, showing they were first years. They each got a wristband that allowed three drinks for the night. On Saturdays you were allowed six which her parents had foretold her would be a lot of fun. </p><p>Teddy asks if he could talk to Jayne in private for a minute, which Diana steps in front, first introducing herself as Jayne’s best friend from their home town.</p><p>Noora looks at Jayne to see if she wants to talk to him alone and Jayne says it’s all right. Noora and Diana go over to the table but were still quite obviously watching Jayne.</p><p>Teddy says right away that he doesn’t want to think about their assignment. That he thinks it’s stupid. Jayne immediately looks around for cameras, which he points out that there were none around and to just relax. He asks if they just want to be friends and that he promises to let Jayne control and decide if she wants to date him. He says he would be happy if that never happened and he really just wants to be her friend. He tells her he thinks she’s really cool.</p><p>Jayne feels a weight lifted off her shoulders and tells him thanks and that she would really like that. She starts to feel more herself. </p><p>Teddy introduces his two friends, Jack and Greg who later end up leaving to meet up with their life mates. All four of them have their 3 drinks</p><p>(Insert shallow conversation)</p><p>and then decide they should start to walk over to the game. Jayne notices she feels kind of different but in a really good way. She was laughing and having a fun time. Noora and Diana also having fun. Jayne was now walking with just Teddy, as Noora and Diana skipped ahead. Jayne says she can’t believe this is what it feels like to b drunk. which surprises Teddy. He asks her that she has never gotten drunk before which she enthusiastically says no! This appalls him, and he tells her he has been getting drunk since he was fourteen. Jayne doesn’t understand how he would have gotten away with that. She says there’s no way. How?</p><p>Teddy shrugs and says he would take it from his fathers secret stash and do it all the time in his backyard tree house with his friends. Jayne says but there’s cameras in there? That’s stupid. Why not in CDT?</p><p>Teddy chuckles and says that’s no fun, plus that racks up your CDT bill and you’d get caught that way? Incredulous, he asks her, so you’ve never tried to do anything illegal in front of the cameras to test it? </p><p>Jayne thought he was weird before but she actually thinks he’s crazy now.</p><p>She says no? Because I’m not insane? How have you not gotten arrested by now?</p><p>Teddy says, People get arrested at random. It’s population control. Then he suddenly shuts down and says, and you shouldn’t say that. Insane. That’s politically incorrect.</p><p>Jayne blurts our a laugh and says so you drank at fourteen in front of cameras, but being politically correct is where you draw the line?</p><p>He says no, I just follow my own rules of right and wrong. And maybe, somebody’s watching <em>you</em>, but I learned from an early age that nobody was ever watching me. Jayne could sense the uncomfortability in his tone and the potential reason behind how he learned, so she says okay, and lets it go. She also realizes that was the first time she saw him seem to care about something someone said. But it was brief, as he instantly went right back into his friendly persona moments afterwards.</p><p>They finally get inside the stadium and people are going wild, chanting and cheering. There is a marching band playing a song while the students chanted something Jayne had never heard before. A cheerleading squad prances in front facing the bleachers.</p><p>Jayne, Noora, Teddy and Diana find a spot and sit up high in the stands. </p><p>The announcer gets on the loudspeaker welcoming everyone and starts rallying off the stats of today. People were going crazy and Jayne thought as a whole, they looked exactly like how she imagined.</p><p>Jayne sees the boy Tooth in a large, standing group of students doing chants and stomping. It looked like a lot of fun. She asks them what’s over there?</p><p>Teddy says that’s the student section. That’s mostly the fraternity and sorority clubs. He says that we wouldn’t want to go over there anyway and that they are snobs. </p><p>Diana asks how do you know that?</p><p>He says his father told him that those groups become snobbish as they realize they’re entitled to something greater than us. Like they were chosen to be in a fraternity and now all of a sudden they go from a nobody to a somebody. It’s like they’re all destined to be assholes.</p><p>Jayne says well I don’t think that’s fair to generalize.</p><p>Teddy says no it’s true. I’ve met a couple already in my classes. And don’t even get me started about the pre-med students. They already think they’re doctors. Like that one down by the front. He is a fucking dick face—</p><p>Diana gasps— oh my— you can’t say... things like that! Isn’t that swearing? She looks at Jayne and then around nervously as Teddy laughs. Jayne starts to giggle too, starting to understand the notion that nobody was watching them closely anymore and it was both freeing and a relief at the same time.</p><p>Jayne says to Teddy “Wait which one?” And Teddy points down below the stands and Jayne sees Tooth hysterically laughing— no wait, now he suddenly stops and frowns at the boy next to him. </p><p>The tall one with the black backpack, Teddy says.</p><p>Jayne looks further to see Tooth with a black backpack on. </p><p>Him? Jayne asks, The one with the #36 tiger jersey?</p><p>Jayne thought it would have been easier to say the dark skinned one but then she thought that would be wrong to generalize by his skin color.</p><p>Teddy looks, then shakes his head and says, no... the one next to him—whos leaving.</p><p>Jayne sees him now. And he was tall. And the only one who wasn’t smiling in the entire stadium sea of cheering students. Tooth leans down saying something that seemed to be serious to him, as he left the bleachers. She watched him walk down the steps. He was unfairly beautiful looking. Definitely known over campus. Girls swooning over him saying goodbye as he left, ignoring them. Not only was he tall, but he was lean, fit and had nearly black-brown hair. He was interestingly attractive. </p><p>“I see him now.” Says Jayne. “But who is he? What did he say?”</p><p>“Sebastian White. He’s a Science and med major. ...And he didn’t <em>say</em> anything. So don’t even try and converse with him because he’s an ass.”</p><p>”How do you know that from him saying nothing?”</p><p>Teddy scoffs, “because I asked him, just one, goddamn question before our organic chemistry pretest... and he acted, or pretended like I wasn’t even there.” He glares at him down below, “All I did was ask him which samples needed a reaction and he looked at me like I was fucking stupid,” he mimics, “like, ‘how do you not know that, bro?’ And then he got up and went and sat somewhere else, without saying a word!</p><p>“Oh.” Jayne notices now what she hadn’t before. How pale his skin was. Of course he thinks he’s better than everyone else. </p><p>Noora says “that’s awful and rude.”</p><p>Jayne zones out. Staring at him as he left the stadium. He suddenly glances up quickly, as he walked out the arched gate, now out of sight. She averted eye contact just in time. She didn’t understand miserable people. She looked around the crowd at everyone laughing and smiling. There were very few people who did not seem to be enjoying themselves. Almost none really. The ones who weren’t would smile moments later or atleast their eyes were hinting some kind of joy. Jayne knew even when she was bored or unhappy she atleast pretended to be happy. This one, though— there was nothing. Why didn’t he pretend like the rest?</p><p>Jayne could care less about the game of football now, she was much more fascinated by the atmosphere of people she was in. She thinks she hasn’t even fully processed how amazing this all was. She loved watching people when they didn’t know they were being watched. Like in their natural environment at the Shopping Mall. But this- was like on thousand to one scale of what she was used to. It was incredible.</p><p>The game starts and so Jayne pays attention because everyone else is. She’s truthfully having a lot of fun, but she’s pretty much pretending it was because of the game. </p><p>Jayne sees Johanna hugging some boy down at the bottom of the bleachers. She thinks she looked like an idiot with her cropped shirt and short shorts.</p><p>Its the second half and we finally score and Jayne and her friends cheer. We were winning 7 to 0. A little while later we score again and Jayne was starting to feel tired. But no one else seemed to look tired so she kept cheering.</p><p>The game ends and they walk out and Teddy asks Jayne if she had fun. Noora and Diana watch her as she nods back. Jayne thinks how she always dreamt and imagined how relationships were supposed to be so romantic and intimate but this... it just felt like a joke. She honestly didn’t care as much anymore though. It didn’t feel as important, now oddly that it was here in front of her. In her dreams, her feelings had felt more real than they do now. And why should she worry about this when her brother was out there. She kept thinking of things she could do, but always ended up failing, considering it would be impossible to help him- and then ended up silently crying later in her room anyway. Everything real that she felt... was when she was alone in her room. When nobody was watching. Everything else was false or projected.</p><p>She hoped her real life would feel more <em>real</em> soon.</p>

As he describes Big Ben and people with small devices that Owen called cellphones.</p><p>Sam talks to Owen at a lunch break.</p><p>Long conversation and Sam inner monologue. He’s sort of listening to Owen but not really. He feels stuck here and trapped and is disappointed there isn’t more to explore and more to the unknown than he thought. He’s also more thinking about where Adam went. It seems like Owen Adam and Sam have become good friends. Sam knows he is in a different kind of place now and he talks about that briefly in conversation about how/when he first realized. </p><p>Owen looks at him Funny then tells him he has to tell him and Adam something serious. Something serious and important but shocking. Adam finally comes back from the bathroom and Sam feels relieved for some reason. He doesn’t like when he’s not around and doesn’t trust being here anymore. (He is showing the reader that he is very much afraid). Adam sits down and Owen eventually tells them that he is an Si...</p><p>both Adam and Sam are equally shocked and don’t believe him.</p><p>owen shows them a small tattoo of his birth number under his underarm.</p><p>they ask him why he’s here with them?</p><p>he tells them he was detained because he is dyslexic and cannot perform to the Si standard reading requirement.</p><p>Sam and Adam say they knew it and are enthusiastic about that it’s confirmed now that the arrest system revolves around grade performance. Owen tells them yes and they send everyone who fails here to work labor jobs for the rest of their life because they can’t properly work the corporate jobs needed to support their political invasion. Adam and Sam go silent because that news didn’t make much sense.</p><p>they ask what he means.</p><p>he tells them the whole reality and that people from the experiment and infiltration only find out until after their children leave for college and they go to “the retirement home” which is why you never see your parents again. Because they get sent down to earth (by particle transportation or “beaming”) and we’ve just been populating until there is enough to support a peaceful invasion with people in the right positions. He says we so far have infiltrated nasa, the fbi, and multiple political campaigners.</p><p>This takes Sam and Adam obviously a long time to process. Sam only asks how his brother knew Jayne and owen says his brother was her OSP. Sam said he thought so. Owen then says his brother is coming to get him. Sam asks how he would he even do that and how does he know? Owen says he has no idea and he can’t explain how, “he just knows it”. Sam is unconvinced but now a lot more curious and motivated to do something.</p>

  <u> <em>Jayne</em> </u>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em><b>Chapter Sixteen: Perspectives of Prejudice</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em><b>Monday, 4:51 PM</b> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <b>November 4th</b></em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Jayne was starting to get into more a routine. Teddy helped her with her gen ed math class. She helped him in their composition writing class. Jayne helped Diana in their biology class. Noora taught Jayne how to cook a couple meals. Noora taught Jayne how to do laundry.</p><p>Noora still didn’t open her envelope. </p><p>It was also strange that whoever Noora’s life mate was, didn’t come looking for her either. Maybe she <em>was</em> waitlisted.</p><p>Jayne was studying in the living room of their dorm when Noora came in with food ingredients from the store. She made everything from scratch and Jayne could not understand why she would do that when it took a minute to microwave soup. Jayne helped her bring in the groceries and Noora asked if she could take her duvet and sheets out of the dryer and back to her room when Jayne dropped off her own laundry. Jayne hadn’t planned on doing laundry but she figured it wasn’t a bad idea. Noora said she had to meet a friend to give them her homework and didn’t have time.</p><p>Jayne gathered her own dirty laundry in her basket and walked down the hall to the elevator. When she got in, Johanna Jenssen was also inside. Johanna fake smiled at her.</p><p>Jayne decided to ask her about Mr. Gellert’s gift. She asked how she knew she should have opened it in CDT. Jayne had gotten much more comfortable saying risky things aloud that could get her into trouble. Because she was starting to realize for herself that it didn’t really make a difference.</p><p>Johanna rolled her eyes and said she got one too and found out the hard way. Luckily she didn’t bring much attention and put it away quickly. Her book was called Anthem by Ayn Rand. She then asked Jayne if she brought it with her to college to which Jayne replied no.</p><p>Johanna said good cause only an idiot would have brought that here. When the door opened to the 7th floor Jayne asked her what she thought it meant, because it was a little frightening. Johanna said she had no clue and motioned her eyes toward the camera in the ceiling. The door closed.</p><p>Jayne thought about her book and in it, the cameras that watched their every move. It was just like her world- only a little different and a slightly bit scarier. It made her feel claustrophobic. She took out Noora’s laundry and put in her own and then went back up to their room.</p><p>She threw Noora’s laundry on her bed. And was about to leave when something caught her eye. It was her life mate envelope in a box in Noora’s closet, but that wasn’t what struck Jayne’s eye. It was what was hidden behind it. She saw a small flash of color- of a paperback book. Jayne quietly went over to it and looked at the cover. It said Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. What did all of these books have in common? Was it something other than an illustrated cover? How strange was it that she just asked Johanna about this today. She wished she had seen Noora’s book beforehand to have been able to tell her it wasn’t just Mr. Gellert. But the more important question was who gave this to Noora? And was it the same source as her, Diana and Johanna?</p><p>Or maybe Johanna was right and it really wasn’t a big deal and Jayne was letting her imagination run. She started to read a couple pages when suddenly she heard the door slam- and Noora had walked straight to her room- only to find Jayne about to run out.</p><p>”What are you doing in here?”</p><p>Jayne looked seriously guilty. “Uhm nothing.”</p><p>“...Were you trying to look at my envelope?”</p><p>Jayne immediately shot that down and said “no no! No, please believe me- I promise it wasn’t that. I would never, that’s your business!</p><p>Her expression told Jayne that she believed her. ”Okay... then why were you in here so long.”</p><p>”Uhm... I saw your book.”</p><p>”Oh... that’s uh—“</p><p>”I have one just like it. A colorful cover too.”</p><p>Noora’s eyes lit up. She walked in and closed the door out of habit. “Really? What is it called?”</p><p>”Well I got Pride and Predjudice when I was fifteen and then for graduation I got 1984.”</p><p>”did they have names on the front, like this one too?” She took it back out from under the envelope.</p><p>”Yes. I think those were the real authors.” Jayne looked at her seriously, “its odd that author credit was erased to begin with, like what’s the purpose?”</p><p>noora gasped like she could not believe Jayne said that. “I thought that too. I got mine for graduation from my teacher also. Woah. I never said that out loud before, wow.”</p><p>they both chuckled at the ridiculousness of the scandal. How unnecessary. </p><p>Jayne looked at her more seriously. “Is yours scary? I left mine at home.”</p><p>noora looked confused. “Scary? No, it’s about a happy world.”</p><p>Jayne could not understand the correlation between all of this. </p><p>“Oh... hmm. Well, Diana got one too. And so did Johanna from my primary school.” </p><p>Noora scrunched her face. “So bizarre.”</p><p>Jayne sat there in silence. Internal monologue about how she wished she talked to Mr. Gellert before she left.</p><p>Suddenly Noora said “give me that.” And motioned to the envelope. Jayne handed it to her.</p><p>”This is completely irrelevant to the books Jayne, but I am going to tell you something very personal.”</p><p>Jayne felt nervous as Noora began to open the envelope. “Okay. But really Noora you don’t have to tell me. I just think you should look is all.”</p><p>“Oh, I already know what’s in here trust me.” She opens it up and pulls out the paper.</p><p>Jayne watches her face fall in acceptance. “I was right.” Noora said.</p><p>”What you’re waitlisted? So is Diana, that’s okay!” </p><p>“No, I wasn’t waitlisted.” She closes her eyes and hands the paper to Jayne.</p><p>It reads from Norway, Male cisgender Evan Ryan Valhassen. Jayne looked up at Noora. “A boy named Evan? Do you know him?”</p><p>”No!” Noora almost laughs. She jumps on her bed hiding her face in the pillow.</p><p>”I don’t get it. You havent met, why hasn’t he tried to contact you either?”</p><p>Noora laughs again, “That’s the even weirder part! I have no idea...”</p><p>Jayne was waiting for her to explain but this clearly, was something she felt very strongly about so she waited.</p><p>Finally Noora spoke up. “Jayne, it’s wrong. I tested it and it’s wrong!” She jumped up. “Nobody is watching us—”</p><p>”What? How do you know that from your life mate results?” Jayne looked at the paper again. </p><p>Noora looked ready to explain. “So you know when you were little, and you kinda started to think maybe Santa Claus and Christmas wasn’t real?”</p><p>Jayne chuckled at where this was going. “Uhm yeah? Why?”</p><p>”Well did you do any tests to see if you were correct?”</p><p>Jayne remembered when she asked for a special doll for Christmas when she was four. But she never said it out loud.</p><p>”Yeah. I didn’t tell my parents but I kept wishing for this toy on my own, in my head.”</p><p>Noora smiled throwing her hand out, “Yes! Me too! And did you get it?”</p><p>”No.”</p><p>”Exactly... So well, I kind of did that on a bigger scale.”</p><p>”How? I don’t think it really works that way anyway, to just wish for a certain person.”</p><p>Noora shook her head and became much more solemn. “No thats not it. It was more of an accidental experiment.” She frowned as her voice got quieter. “Jayne... I don’t like boys.”</p><p>Jayne was waiting for what else. “Okay...” she shrugged. “So there must be a mistake. I’m sure someone can fix it?”</p><p>Noora looked shocked. “What do you mean?” She mocked her shrug, “Like that’s not surprise?”</p><p>Jayne squinted at her. “No, it surprised me? But it’s not something to worry about? I still don’t understand how this relates to Santa Claus.”</p><p>Noora sighed. “I never told anyone I liked girls in Primary school.”</p><p>Jayne gaped at her. “Why not? How long have you planned to do this?”</p><p>”I didn’t plan on any of this! Every single girl in my town liked boys! I thought there was something wrong with me. Like I wasn’t supposed to be this way.”</p><p>Jayne thought about the three girls in her class that were gay. And the four boys. </p><p>“Wait, you were the only one?” </p><p>Noora actually looked sad now. “Yes. And girls can be so mean, you know. Well, they were never mean to me specifically, because I was good at pretending. But they hurt my feelings all the time.”</p><p>Jayne felt so sorry for Noora. But at the same time, she couldn’t help but feel selfishly less alone. Then she realized something. Prejudice depended upon its population. Its unique form always morphing by supply and demand. </p><p>“I am so sorry Noora. We will fix this.” She stood up and hugged her.</p><p>Noora nodded. “Yes, okay.” </p><p>“So...” Jayne was now putting it all together. “You think that because you never told anyone that out loud, and you were assigned a boy...”</p><p>”Nobody was paying close attention.”</p><p>”Or nobody was ever there at all.” Jayne winced.</p><p>She didn’t know how to feel right now. Teddy had tried to convince her too. But she originally thought he was crazy. She knew it made sense. But nothing made sense as a whole. There were too many parts.</p><p>“Wow.” Noora started to smile. “I feel like a new person.”</p><p>Jayne stood up to face her. “Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me that.” She started to walk out. “You decide what’s next. Do you want to tell someone? Or do you want to find out what’s up with this Evan?”</p><p>Noora sighed. “No, lets find Evan.” She started to put her laundry away. “I’m actually really curious about that myself.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  <u> <em>Jayne</em> </u>
</p><p>Jayne and Noora were able to track down the name Evan Ryan Valhassen. They were in the school’s hr lobby. </p><p>The woman at the front desk clicked on her computer. “I’m sorry girls. Evan... was arrested before school began. I can’t believe you weren’t notified when you received your package. We’ll switch you right away to the waiting list.”</p><p>Noora frowned. She was still hoping there was a mix-up. Jayne nudged her to see about switching to make sure there wasn’t another “mistake.” Noora said maybe later.</p><p>She then said to Jayne later that she wondered what he did to have gotten arrested. Jayne still hadn’t told her about her brother.</p><p>They head to their next class with Teddy. He saved them a spot like always and smiled when they walked in. </p><p>During math class, Noora told Teddy she found out she’s on the waiting list.</p><p>He smiled and said it’s all right and she would be placed with someone in no time.</p><p>•</p><p>new chap.</p><p>sev</p><p>Class with Johanna in it. She is v obnoxious and other girls are flirty with him but he ignores. After class he meets up with Tooth and honey. At sevs apartment they talk about how it’s going to happen soon and as soon as it does they need to move. </p><p>Basically we have no idea what they are talking about until someone mentions the chancellor being sick. </p><p>It appears they have been plotting for what comes after his death.</p><p>•</p><p>new chap</p><p>jayne</p><p>At the end of class, Jayne walked out and felt someone large and tall bump into her. Teddy and Noora both scowled at the person—and it seemed to be a boy, but he had his hood up.</p><p>”Jayne are you okay?”</p><p>She smiled, shaking it off. “Yeah, I’m fine. Now, I’m starving do you guys want to go eat?”</p><p>Teddy said he had to meet his other friends but he would find them later if they wanted to do dinner. They say okay and leave.</p><p>Noora and Jayne enter the cafeteria and see the usual tables in their arrangements of social order. The football players sat with the cheerleaders. The artsy students all sat together etc. This was nothing new to Jayne. Things had been this way in primary school. </p><p>Diana met up with them with her roommate Sasha. Sasha didn’t usually sit with them, but Jayne figured Diana was probably making her. She said to Jayne in private that the girl told her she missed her family and liked her friends from home better. Diana didn’t take that personally, just more as a challenge.</p><p>Diana said that finally she got a notice about Book club and that they would meet later tonight. </p><p>Jayne said she didn’t know she was in book club? And she didn’t get a notice. </p><p>Noora said she didn’t get a notice either.</p><p>Diana reads it and it says “Book club first meeting rescheduled to 6pm in the mailroom lounge.”</p><p>Jayne hated when she had mailroom shifts at night. It was extremely creepy. Although she ironically did go to the lounge to read there when she finished her assortments. It was very peaceful and quiet. She anxiously felt as if she weren’t as alone, as shed thought. It was a big place. But with her job it was pretty interesting. Nothing great, she didn’t get to edit anything yet, but she had secretly read a couple! Most of them were boring. No daring love letters or funny complaints.</p><p>Noora looked to Jayne. “You think it’s the same book club? How do you know if there’s more than one?”</p><p>Diana shook her head. “Well this is the only one that’s canceled the past 6 weeks.”</p><p>Jayne frowned. “Wait, can I see that? Where did you get this from?”</p><p>She read under the flyer title. “Bring your book. You know which one.” She freezes. “Diana?? Did someone explain to you what that meant?”</p><p>Jayne gasped as Diana told her no, and it just ended up in her bag. “Diana! What if they mean our “books”” and her eyes flashed so she knew Diana understood. </p><p>“What? No! It probably means to bring your favorite.” She smirks, “I was planning on bringing, To Save A Mockingbird.” </p><p>Noora looked skeptical. “Well either way we can just show up to find out. It’s not like it’s a grade. It’s just a club, right Jayne?”</p><p>She shrugged playing it off. “Oh yeah, definitely.”</p><p>Later on, when Jayne and Noora returned to their room, Jayne noticed something in Noora’s bag’s back pocket. The flyer.</p><p>She checked her own bag and found her own flyer resting neatly on top of her books.</p><p>”Noora. Look at this...” She held it out. “Who bumped into us earlier?”</p><p>”I don’t know. You think they were the one who gave it to us?”</p><p>“Yes. Because they planned this club meeting. And they clearly didn’t want to be seen.”</p><p>But why?</p>

    <p>6pm that night Noora Diana and Jayne walk to the mailroom.</p><p>The arrived at the lounge and Jayne feels irrationally terrified.</p><p>Then she sees Teddy. There was already a circle of probably the most unrandom group of people she could have imagined.</p><p>Tooth. Of course. The black lipstick girl. Her, Diana, and Noora. The Asian cheerleader who wore a short white wig today with bangs. Two football players she was sure of. One possible football player- the one who wore the strange paper glasses that had one blue lense and one red. She had seen him before and thought to herself “why” but hadn’t really thought of him again until now. Then there was her orientation tour guide Millie. And Teddy.</p><p>Teddy waved them over and Jayne walked over, curiously looking around as everyone else chatted amongst themselves.</p><p>“What is this Teddy?” Jayne asked. “I didn’t know you were supposed to be here too?”</p><p>Teddy chuckled. “Yeah, I’m not sure. We’ll probably talk about books.”</p><p>Jayne rolled her eyes as her Noora and Diana sat down on either side of them.</p><p>”Okay!” The Asian girl clapped holding a clipboard. “We’re not missing anyone right?” She starts counting.</p><p>”One more.” The light-dark skinned football player said. He wore a Mickey Mouse sweater and a backwards SnapBack hat and Jayne rememebered he was definitely the football player who accidentally knocked Johanna Jenssen’s Lunch tray to the ground one time. Her chocolate milk spilled all over her shirt. Jayne and Diana laughed a lot.</p><p>Speaking of Johanna... Jayne’s eyes widened upon seeing her heading towards their group in the lounge.</p><p>”Is this book club?” </p><p>“Yes, yes, honey come sit! Come sit!” The Asian girl announced.</p><p>the black lipstick girl laughed. “Vivian. When you say ‘Honey’... you need to be more specific.”</p><p>Oh right, Jayne remembered that was the girl’s name.</p><p>Johanna looked at Jayne with a apprehensive expression.</p><p>“Okay, uhm. Zedd, would you do the honors?”</p><p>the boy with the 3D glasses stood up and slid the glasses to rest on his ears and his forehead. He walked over and slammed a small, metal... box on the wall. Jayne had no clue what it was but the boy lifted a metal flap on the box and then typed in some kind of a code. Then he came and sat back down, chewing on a pen.</p><p>“Okay... so welcome to Book club everyone!”</p><p>Tooth chuckled heartily. “First rule of Book club. You can’t talk about Book club.”</p><p>Jayne raised an eyebrow. What?</p><p>”They haven't seen Fight Club, dumbass.” The Asian girl- Vivian, quipped. Diana gawked at her.</p><p>”Oh right- sorry...” Tooth mumbled. Jayne thought it was weird because it seemed like they all knew each other- really well. And Tooth said he was the only one from his town that came to their college.</p><p>Jayne needed some answers. What was going on? </p><p>“Okay so did you all bring... the book?” Vivian smiled scandalously.</p><p>Jaynes heart dropped. She whipped a look at Diana that said I told you.</p><p>Diana was good at playing a game though. “What book?” She asked.</p><p>Everyone but Jayne Noora Teddy and Johanna chuckled. Diana shrugged flatly, “were you all told something we weren’t?”</p><p>“You all received a book from your primary school teacher, correct?” Vivian looked around.</p><p>The rest all held up their books. Even Teddy! His said, 2001 A Space Odyssey.</p><p>Oh no... what if she was in trouble for leaving it behind?</p><p>Jayne raised her hand.</p><p>Vivian giggled, “Oh my gosh, you’re so cute. Do you have a question?”</p><p>”I left mine at home. Am I going to get in trouble? I thought it was safer to leave it there.”</p><p>”Aww! No you’re completely fine, girl.” She looked sweetly to the other football boy in the circle. That rude Sebastian boy. “You’re safe here.” She head nodded to the box Zedd installed on the wall. Why did that mean they were safe?</p><p>Johanna spoke up this time. “<em>How</em> is this safe? These books are illegal.”</p><p>The backwards hat boy rolled his eyes. </p><p>Vivian assured Johanna and the rest of them they were safe and no one was watching them. Tooth and Millie chuckled, making Honey smack Tooth’s arm.</p><p>“Okay well this isn’t completely about the books anyway.” Honey announced abrasively. “You’re here because, you all lost-“ </p><p>“Not yet, Hun.” Vivian cut her off. “Soon, but not yet.”</p><p>Honey sat back, looking pissed off. “Well look at them. Explain <em>something</em> to them.” She waved an arm out towards Noora who looked shell shocked. </p><p>“Okay...” Vivian snapped. “Lets just do a normal greeting, first. Introduce yourself, your book, and something... you like.”</p><p>There was an uncomfortable silence for a moment.</p><p>“I’ll start.” The boy with the backwards hat started. </p><p>“My name is Wells Gonzalez and my book was Alice in Wonderland. And I like puppies.” </p><p>Tooth giggled. “Awww, you’re so adorable.” He cooed. “Okay, uh... my name is Thomas Thompson, but everyone calls me Tooth. My book was Revolutionary Road and... I like candy.” He laughs deeply at himself, pulling out licorice from his pocket. “A lot.” </p><p>Then next to him, the black lipstick girl. “...Hi, I’m Honey Ira Lima. My book was A Clockwork Orange. And I like black.”</p><p>“Black what?” Tooth choked out, bursting a laugh. </p><p>“Black <em>clothes</em>, you freak.” Honey spewed out in mirth, as the boy next to her chuckled.</p><p>”Zedd Winston Walker. Animal Farm. And... Steven Spielberg.”</p><p>Vivian clapped at him, “No! They don’t know him either, you ninny! Pick a new one.”</p><p>”...Okay, I like movies.”</p><p>Vivian sighed in bored annoyance. “Okay, my name is Vivian Yen. My book was We by Yevgeny Zamyatin. And I love summer! Okay, Seb.”</p><p>The boy in the corner who hadn’t flinched an expression this entire time said, “Sebastian White. My book was The Giver. And... I don’t like Vivian.” </p><p>“Sebastian!” Vivian croaked while the rest didn’t look surprised. “I said the rules were something you <em>like</em>.”</p><p>”You said, and I love summer!” He mocked dryly. “Do you like it or love it...” Zedd chuckled along with him. “Thought it could be anything along those lines.”</p><p>”Oh, so cheeky.” Vivian then turned around to Jayne, and the rest of them. “Don’t mind him. He’s not nice.” Then she smiled at him wide, “But he doesn’t mean it.”</p><p>“Yes I do.”</p><p>She groaned with a smirk. ”Okayyy! Next is...” She motioned to Millie. </p><p>“Hello, my name is Millie May Okeke. And my book was Walden Two, by B.F. Skinner. And I like to make my own earrings.”</p><p>”Ooh what do they say today?” Honey peered over wickedly.</p><p>Millie looked down to her right ear, “Uhm, on this side, it says, ‘Wraiths,” and then on this side, it says ‘Wraiths on Wings’.”</p><p>”Jesus Christ I love that.” Zedd remarks.</p><p>Diana looks to him and then takes a breath. “Hi... I’m Diana. And I tore up my book.” </p><p>Jayne glared at her in awestruck horror, but everyone actually laughed in response.</p><p>It was her confident delivery. </p><p>“Tell me she had the book burning one.” Honey smirked quietly.</p><p>”Fahrenheit 451...” Diana bit her lip.</p><p>”Oh, how goddamn ironic.” Vivian shook her head. “I hope you got rid of the remains?”</p><p>”Yes, of course.” Diana smiled politely.</p><p>”All right and what do you like, darling?” Vivian batted her eyes.</p><p>“Well, I guess <em>I like,” </em>Diana smirked, “I like <em>not</em> swearing.”</p><p>“Ohhhhaha—” Tooth and Honey snorted together, bursting into a fit of laughter as Vivian sneered back at them annoyed again. “Oh no, dear me and my filthy tongue. I’ll try and stop. Sorry to’ve bothered you.”</p><p>Everyone then turned to Teddy as he spoke up. “Hi. I’m Theodore. But you can call me Teddy. And my book was 2001: A Space Odyssey. And I really liked this book.”</p><p>Jayne had such odd admiration for him.</p><p>”Oh, bravo! Great answer!” Vivian beamed.</p><p>Noora was next. And then after was Jayne. She felt her anxiety crippling her stomach into a flutter of nerves. She sat on her hands.</p><p>”Hello, hi, I’m Noora. And my book was uh, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. And I like... fashion and make-up.”</p><p>”Very nice.” Vivian approved. “Two more, and then maybe we could call it a night. Next time actually talk about... the books...”</p><p>Jayne felt her heart thudding in her chest. Why did this happen to her?</p><p>“Hi.” She swallowed thickly. “My name is Jayne. Uhm. With a ‘y’-“</p><p>”Why... what sweetie? Speak up a little.” </p><p>Jayne crossed her arms. “No, I mean spelled with a ‘y’ in the middle-“ </p><p>Vivian nodded towards her, “Ohhh, ‘y’ the letter... not the word— okay—“</p><p>”—Jesus Christ, let her fucking talk?” Sebastian remained still, with his arms crossed.</p><p>His support confused Jayne.</p><p>“Yikes... sorry sorry. Vivian backed down immediately. “Go on, Jayne. Sorry.”</p><p>“Okay. Well my first colorful book was Pride and Predjudice, from when I was 15? Uhhh, I’m not sure if were sharing all colorful books given by our teachers?”</p><p>Most of them turned to look at the corner of the room. It seemed like their directed vision was at Sebastian or Zedd but it was probably at the security code box. Because it just lightly beeped randomly. Jayne glanced at it.</p><p>Viv cleared her throat, this time more obviously eyeing Sebastian, “and How many colorful books <em>did</em> you receive, my dear?” She looked back to Jayne.</p><p>“Oh, no, just two,” she shook her head, “And then my second one was 1984 by George Orwell... which uh, it kinda scared me, so I only got halfway.”</p><p>Tooth smiled patiently, “...That’s the scariest one— in my opinion. Its okay. It is the most relevant in the literal sense.”</p><p>Jayne squinted an eye. “Uh huh... and I like... history.”</p><p>Jayne definitely saw Sebastian smirk. Or smile. Something rude. This first time she ever saw his expression change. Had he been making fun of her in his head this whole time? Maybe Teddy was right about him.</p><p>”Wow, I love that answer?” Vivian glowed. </p><p>Jayne felt her adrenaline coursing through her entire body. How had stress evolved this way? She was literally in no danger.</p><p>Johanna perked up. “Okay, my name is Johanna Jenssen.” She asserted. “And my book was Anthem by Ayn Rand.” She cheek-clicks a grin, “Which I also left at home... and I like to work.”</p><p>”Ooohhh a hard worker here, very nice...” Vivian applauded. “Maybe you could teach our friend— Wells here, a thing or two.” Wells was falling asleep, so she kicked his foot hard, making him snuff I’m woken irritation. </p><p>Jayne was having trouble processing all of this. Nothing fit into a whole puzzle. There were pieces missing that clearly others knew about and that made Jayne angry. She felt talked down to and she wanted to know what was going on.</p><p>Vivian concluded the session by swearing an oath of secrecy and that they would all be meeting next Thursday again.</p><p>Jayne didn’t want to go back but her fascination with the others kept her interested.</p><p> </p>

  <em>(End of the school year)</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Jayne had work with Noora. This was the first day Millie wasn’t there to supervise. They planned an idea.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Jayne was going to search the number 7251 on postal record with the name Sebastian White. And Noora was going to search Fiv’s number.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Even though they figured out their motive for the fake club to be about losing someone at the Plantation... Jayne knew there was still something off about the others.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Jayne searched for a long time but she finally came across a fax error. It said, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>#7251</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>FAX ERROR! Do Not Read: Confidential</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shred immediately under the court of law.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Jayne hesitated a moment before reading on. She checked over her shoulder and saw that the cameras weren’t on. She decided she would show Noora later because she didn’t want to draw attention right now.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She took the fax error post-it off the front page and began to read.</em>

  <em>[Dear Jayne,</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Valerie, Microphone on please.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>This letter is for you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>A long, long time ago, in a holistic world no further than right here... life, had no meaning. No purpose, without hatred, violence, war and </em>discrimination<em>. </em></p><p>
  <em>But as one may see it, a life without those purpose-propelling tools of bravery, meant a life without choice. And a life without choice, could be argued as impeccably worse than a rocked, free world of chaos. </em>
</p><p><em>But for one to especially realize what a very real, reality of chaos would really look like- a reality, that one may never acknowledge again- they must understand that </em>choice, <em>and</em> <em>options</em>, were <em>inexplicably what drove one’s human nature to sin. To sin, as in ways of pride and envy, propitiated, by their innate need for greed and brewing rapture for wrath. This, which you, Jayne, have never acted upon. Because you don’t know how. </em></p><p>
  <em>And I hate you entirely. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hate you beyond comprehendability because you are of such low importance to me, and yet I am still obligated to follow you around, studying you, as you trip about like a lost lab rat. And though I can clearly see the maze from above, as well as had the opportunity to have seen it being designed, my focus on you has dragged me down such a wildly unrealistic path of frantic distraction.</em>
</p><p><em>And it’s rather funny... because you know nothing of what you don’t have. What you </em><em>could</em> <em>have. What we have, here, on this other side? Aren’t you unhappy like me? We have more than you have, why aren’t I happy?</em></p><p>
  <em>Of course you’re happy. You don’t care. ...Like a dandelion in the wind, you couldn’t care less where you were going, let alone where the wind came from.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And I’ve seen you be, so blindly happy- yes, almost every day at work, for nearly my entire life. You're happy until you get stressed and then you cry. And then you’re happy again. It’s quite funny when you think of it out of context. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>You don’t believe in me anymore I know that, but it really has come to bother me as of late. In fact, I find your lack of faith rather disturbing, Jayne. Why don’t you wonder anymore? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>You never used to be afraid to speak your mind?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But to briefly explain to you in short language, Jayne- how your world/our world became the way it was- and it won’t be just what you’ve been taught in history class. No, there was so much more.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So here, was the lawfully decided question that changed life as you never knew it, forever:</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“</em>
  <em>Was the sacrifice of choice, the key to world peace?”</em>
</p><p><em>But isn’t</em> <em>that a contradiction all on its own?</em></p><p>
  <em>What am I doing here, watching you wander about aimlessly without any sense of purpose or direction- when I could be spending my efforts on more important things, like actually protecting civilization. Places like the Plantation of Criminals could surely use my help. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I would serve as an excellent guard there.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And Jayne, how have you become so shallow... to be brainwashed by their microwaveable selling and superficial slogans? You know, I once thought you were smart, like I. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I once thought you were a lot of things... As another part of myself, I suppose. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But of course, I was a foolish, rose tinted, thirteen year old then. And I have since learned of the ill dangers of letting one’s emotions interfere with work.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> I don’t like being ill.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But now, you must be so brainwashed that you have completely forgotten how to think, and all you talk about now is your impending “future dream life.” That you comedically have no control over.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes, but I do.</em>
</p><p>Yes, oh, <em>I</em> do- and oh will you ever so emphatically not enjoy your Career, I can tell you that much. Yes, your cherishable linguistical intellect, unnaturally attained empathy and creative talents could be so easily overlooked.</p><p>That’s the bleak beauty of this whole system. Nobody will notice and nobody will care. Nobody will see your confused, deep-dwelling misery behind those falsely lit, compelled eyes because you will hide it. And you will go on pretending like you are happy like the rest, I have no doubt, and will assuredly assume.</p><p>And I feel no remorse.</p><p>Though this is all hypothetical, of course. Because I will in no way actually get to carry out these threats, considering I am writing this to you in a letter. But I still mean it all the same.</p><p><em>I hate you. I hate you</em> <em>because you do absolutely nothing wrong. Isn’t that terrible? That I have to sit here, year upon year, uselessly monitoring your silly childish adventures... like I were a ghost and actually there with you- as you, ironically run around in your maze-trap-of-a-box-life... doing absolutely nothing right! </em></p><p>
  <em>Responsibly right, for your life, I mean. You yourself would think the contradiction was quite paramountly poetic. You’re happy one minute, and then crying the next. It’s exhausting, honestly. Why don’t you pay more attention? </em>

    <p align="center">Kylo hated Hux for the way he looked at him.<br/>
He was a sadist.<br/>
Corrupted and cold, with frigid eyes that shined in the same fashion.<br/>
Just like the way he propped himself up on his chair<br/>
With a leather boot like onyx.</p><p align="center">Observing the men in the control room<br/>
You could tell by the smirk on his face<br/>
That they had done satisfactory work.<br/>
And no one would want to make General Hux upset<br/>
Considering that he owned every one of Those men<br/>
Living with no purpose other than to serve Their higher power.</p><p align="center">Meaning:<br/>
A single slip up could cost a life.</p><p align="center">But<br/>
What those men didn't know was that he also owned The Commander.<br/>
Their Superior,<br/>
The Knight,<br/>
Kylo Ren.</p><p align="center">Even from across the room Hux's eyes Pierced into him.<br/>
And maybe the true reason why he was Smirking was because he was there too.</p><p align="center">Soon, none of his power would matter<br/>
Because Supreme Leader would be there.<br/>
When that does happen,<br/>
Poor<br/>
Totalitarian Hux<br/>
Will be reduced to nothing but dirt.</p>

    <p align="center">What the men Hux owned didn't know<br/>Was that Hux's cold eyes could be warm<br/>Especially at nighttime.</p>
<p align="center">It was publicly known that Hux was a serial<br/>Insomniac, but what they didn't know<br/>Was the amount of Melatonin pills he took <br/>Just to<br/>Combat that.</p>
<p align="center">Kylo knew. <br/>He knows a lot about Hux.<br/>Probably more than Hux realizes.</p>
<p align="center">When the Melatonin doesn't work<br/>(As it always doesn't...)<br/>Hux turns to reading, or rarely smoking.</p>
<p align="center">That night was a kind of night for smoking.<br/>It turned the oxygen entirely claustrophobic<br/>Even made Kylo's breathes of despair loud enough for Hux to hear.</p>
<p align="center">He trickled the cigarette over the ashtray's edge,<br/>Quickly retreating to Kylo, <br/>Who had candle wax tears,<br/>And galaxies from outside's window speckled in his miserable eyes.</p>
<p align="center">Hux did not dare caress him.<br/><strong>"What's wrong?"</strong></p>
<p align="center">Kylo wiped the tears away,<br/>Ran fingers over his scar.<br/><em>"I miss him."</em></p>
<p align="center">Looking up at Hux's eyes,<br/>How caring they seemed</p>
<p align="center">Just made Kylo hate him a little more.</p>

    <p align="center">Hux did manage falling asleep that night,<br/>
So maybe the Melatonin worked this time,<br/>
But he was long gone by the time Kylo Awoke.</p><p align="center">It was typical of him to do that.</p><p align="center">Kylo yawned and stretched, staring out of His bedroom window for a good two Minutes, then proceeded to wake himself Up.</p><p align="center">He wasted most of his time trying to find His clothes, which he found on a counter By the bathroom, neat and folded, obviously Hux's doing,<br/>
Because he doesn't do that.</p><p align="center">On top of his clothes laid a single Chocolate, accompanied by a paper.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"I had this and didn't want it.</strong><br/>
<strong>Figured you would.</strong><br/>
<strong>-H."</strong>
</p><p align="center">That made him smile.<br/>
Hux is so nice.</p><p align="center">Kylo ate the chocolate and put on his Clothes, leaving the room to find Hux on the bridge.</p><p align="center">He had those icy eyes again.</p>

Achromatic conundrum.</p><p align="center">It left Kylo to lie on his side of his bed,<br/>
Lifeless<br/>
As Hux made his final check on his<br/>
Data pad,<br/>
Looking forward to relishing the<br/>
Tranquility of a book.</p><p align="center">He would poke out.<br/>
Time and time again.<br/>
Tell Kylo to <b>"grow up"</b> or to <b>"talk to me"</b>.</p><p align="center">Kylo disregarded him.<br/>
(Pigheaded son of a bitch.)</p><p align="center">Hux didn't understand.<br/>
He never will.</p><p align="center">Hux would never understand the<br/>
Horror of killing one's father.<br/>
How much it fucked Kylo up.<br/>
Made his head implode with the<br/>
Overwhelming disarray.<br/>

Patricide...)</p><p align="center">But,<br/>
And regarding what REALLY made<br/>
Him upset,</p><p align="center">Stormtroopers had been taught to fight<br/>
Their whole lives.</p><p align="center">Did Phasma-<br/>
Or <em>Hux</em><br/>
Even teach them about babies?<br/>
Did they know what babies were?<br/>
Babies don't attack people!<br/>
How naive it is to posses<br/>
An army that was so-<br/>
Repulsively benighted!<br/>
(Except for FN-2187, he was special.<br/>
No longer a traitor,<br/>
Now maybe even a <strong>heretic</strong>.)</p><p align="center">
  <b>"Are you proud of me?"</b>
</p><p align="center">The question came out of the blue<br/>
Just to set Kylo on fire.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Are you proud of yourself, Hux?<br/>

</p><p align="center">Hux turned completely and utterly sour.<br/>
<b>"Are you saying you feel pity for them?"</b></p><p align="center">Kylo scowled,</p><p align="center">
  <em>"maybe I am.<br/>
Was it really necessary to destroy that planet like that?"</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux's face was red.<br/>
He opened his mouth to speak,<br/>
But nothing came out.</p><p align="center">Kylo's frown at him faded at a thought.</p><p align="center">His face started to soften.<br/>
His bottom lip quivered.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"A stormtrooper slaughtered a baby in my arms."</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>"Why were you holding it?<br/>
Why didn't you kill it?"</b>
</p><p align="center">Kylo sat up from the bed<br/>
With a voice so horribly raucous that it even<br/>
Made Hux cower.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"IT'S NOT HUMAN TO KILL BABIES LIKE THAT, HUX. They're innocent, they can't defend themselves! They can't even plead for their life, neither can they comprehend the basic concept of life or death. But I do know that they feel pain, and the pain you caused to that insurmountable amount of babies is blasphemy! And you're all responsible for it! You could have stopped it, though I know you won't. Still, I dream you will someday! How DARE you gift them death when they don't even know what that is."</em>
</p><p align="center">Kylo shook, fragile as glass from his own words.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Why did you do it?"</em>
</p><p align="center">A vase shook, then shattered.<br/>
No one touched it.<br/>
(Kylo)<br/>
The liquid inside<br/>
Waterfalled over the edge of a table<br/>
Until it was reduced to nothing but a trickle.</p><p align="center">Hux's browbone hurt.<br/>
When he went to go touch it,<br/>
A minuscule amount of blood<br/>
Along with a shard of glass<br/>
Stuck to it.<br/>
He was disturbed,<br/>
But<br/>
He stayed poised.<br/>
Thankful the glass had missed his eye.<br/>
(Kylo oh Kylo the things Snoke would do<br/>
To you if he just heard what you said.)</p><p align="center">
  <b>"I did it for the First Order."</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Oh yes because EVERYTHING has to be for the First Order. Is there anything you care about besides that?"</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux didn't dare make eye contact with him.<br/>
If he did, he might have died.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Answer me, Hux."</em>
</p><p align="center">He gave in.</p><p align="center">
  <b>"No."</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Not even me?"</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux stood up at that.<br/>
Such an absurd question!<br/>
<b>"What the fuck are you getting at Kylo?"</b></p><p align="center">It was as if Kylo's entire world had<br/>
Been obliterated with a single question.<br/>
All blood drained from his face, so he became<br/>
As white as the pillows he lied upon.<br/>

  <b>"I might."</b>
</p><p align="center">She raised a brow, "you do."</p><p align="center">Hux blushed.<br/><b>"I do."</b></p><p align="center">She smiled under her helmet.<br/>"Are you going to talk to him about it?"</p><p align="center">Hux gasped melodramatically, slapping the <br/>Captain's shoulder, <br/>The metal stung him more than it did her,</p><p align="center">

  <em>"I wanted to talk."</em>
</p><p align="center">Phasma nodded her head.<br/> "Okay. Well, what do you want to talk about?"</p><p align="center">Kylo lifted his brow and pointed behind her,<br/> <em>"Who is in your bed?

Just offered to change Hux's mind if he tried to kill him,"<br/> Then she rolled her eyes,<br/> "Didn't last for long. Probably the most unsatisfying sex I've had to date. He only focused on himself, the fact of whether or not I climax meant nothing to him. I never did, though, and that's when you caught me. I was fixing my problem."</p><p align="center">She sighed, then yawned,<br/> "Honestly, that's probably the last time I'm sleeping with a man for a long time. Sometimes they can be such vain creatures.<br/> But you're special, Ren.<br/> You think like a woman."</p><p align="center"><em>"Why would you say that?"</em> He asked.</p><p align="center">"I don't really know... I can just tell. You seem a lot more brighter than the other boys.

    <p align="center">Getting into Kylo's bed again was like<br/>
A sense of home that Hux hadn't felt<br/>
In forever.<br/>
(Loneliness could help itself now.)</p><p align="center">Kylo was beside him,<br/>
Pondering why he hadn't taken his<br/>
Melatonin yet.</p><p align="center">His back was faced to him,<br/>
Though the blue light of the datapad<br/>
stretched passed him and absorbed through his eyelids.</p><p align="center">It forced him to turn over and ask,<br/>

Button,<br/>
<strong>"I'm discussing with Colonel Datoo regarding the next planet we are doing to destroy.

Leaned against Hux's right shoulder. Watching his finger.<br/>
<em>"Starkiller base is destroyed. All we have now is to find Luke Skywalker. Don't you think plotting these attacks would get in the way of that?"</em></p><p align="center">Hux furrowed his eyebrows,<br/>
<strong>"This is literally the only thing we have left to do at the moment. Finding Luke Skywalker has already proved to be an onerous task.

Of course we are still keeping tabs on that droid, but I also believe that these attacks will keep the Resistance from getting too cocky over a hiatus if we ever even did that."</strong></p><p align="center">Kylo yawned,<br/>
Pushing away those unwanted memories<br/>
From beautiful Orellius.<br/>
(What if Hux could change?)<br/>
<em>"Don't you want to be known for something greater other than being feared?"</em></p><p align="center">
  <strong>"I don't want to be known for the fear, I want to be known for the power."</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"You derive your power from fear."</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Who fears me then?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Your men."</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Do you fear me Kylo?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">Maybe he won't change.</p><p align="center"><em>"No I don't."</em><br/>
Thankfully a thought popped into<br/>
Kylo's mind,<br/>
<em>"Have you ever considered that you can be powerful from being liked?"</em></p><p align="center">
  <strong>"How can that happen, Ren? You get people to obey you by making them afraid of you."</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"No, Hux! You can get people to obey you using respect."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux sighed,<br/>
<strong>"Plenty of people respect me."</strong></p><p align="center"><em>"But they're just like you Hux. They get power from fear too,"</em><br/>
Dare he even say it?<br/>
Would it be okay to say it?<br/>
What would happen if he did?<br/>
<em>"People like- people like my Mother...</em><br/>
<em> S-she...</em><br/>
<em> A lot of people like her and respect her...</em><br/>
<em> They listen to her Hux."</em></p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Your mother wants me dead."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Kylo looked down.<br/>
He had a point.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Me too."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux looked at him.<br/>
Confusion was stickered to his face.<br/>
<strong>"What mother would want to kill her child? Her own flesh and blood?"</strong></p><p align="center">Kylo still didn't lift his face up.<br/>
There was no denying that<br/>
Hux had a point.</p><p align="center">But<br/>
She had every reason to want to<br/>
Murder him.<br/>
Kylo was dirty for everything he did!</p><p align="center">
  <em>"I killed father...</em><br/>
<em> She probably wishes upon my death every night before she sleeps.</em><br/>
<em> I wonder what she would have done if she knew her womb held a monster."</em>
</p><p align="center">Vague childhood memories started to plague<br/>
Him.<br/>
It was when he was Ben,<br/>
And Ben was pathetic.<br/>
So pathetic in fact that his parents<br/>
Didn't love him enough to let him be with<br/>
Them!<br/>
He wasted his life away with his<br/>
Uncle!<br/>
Practicing the force, day in and day out!<br/>
That was his entire childhood!<br/>
Nobody came by to tell him hello,<br/>
Nor did his parents visit<br/>
Or show him love.</p><p align="center">Love was what he found in Snoke,<br/>
So he reincarnated as Kylo.</p><p align="center">Kylo wasn't sure if Snoke was<br/>
Genuine or not anymore.</p><p align="center">Questioning Snoke made him hurt.<br/>
(What would grandfather do?)</p><p align="center">Kylo cocooned himself beneath his bed<br/>
Because surely, with adequate sleep,<br/>
He wouldn't be questioning Snoke<br/>
Tomorrow.</p><p align="center">When he makes his arrival,<br/>
Kylo would be okay again.</p><p align="center">Hux turned off the datapad and laid down<br/>
Too.<br/>
He stared at Kylo<br/>
As nearby planets augmented<br/>
His eyes.<br/>
They enriched Kylo's tears too as if<br/>
They had become stained glass.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"The light is hurting me, Hux."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux wiped away the tears.<br/>
The wetness even sprawled around his face,<br/>
Where he had become a portrait.</p><p align="center">The paint shimmered eerily on his thumb.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"The light goes away, it always does. If it doesn't, then I'll make it go."</strong>

    <p align="center">General Hux and Colonel Datoo<br/>
Quarreled back and fourth<br/>
About which planet to attack next<br/>
Until they reached their<br/>
Goldilocks resolution.</p><p align="center">It was Iona.</p><p align="center">Predicted to be easy enough to take out<br/>
For Datoo,<br/>
Yet having a population with adequate<br/>
Artillery to<br/>
Satisfy Hux's blood lust.</p><p align="center">"Should we start preparing then General?"<br/>
The Colonel asked.</p><p align="center">Hux nodded.<br/>
<strong>"How long do you think we'll be able to attack before Supreme Leader makes his arrival?"</strong></p><p align="center">"Two, maybe three days."</p><p align="center">A wave of sweet ebony blanketed Hux's<br/>
Proud body.<br/>
It made him smirk.<br/>
<strong>"That's perfect."</strong></p><p align="center">Footsteps entered the area.<br/>
They pounded like pistons,<br/>
Making their way to The Bridge.<br/>
Creeping<br/>
Up to Hux until the figure was at<br/>
Least a foot behind him.</p><p align="center">"General."<br/>
She wanted to hit him she wanted to<br/>
Smack him she wanted to do anything<br/>
With her iron hands<br/>
That would make Hux go and<br/>
Start talking to him.<br/>
(Too bad that if she did in that moment,<br/>
She'd probably be assaulted.)</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Captain?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">"Kylo Ren visited me."</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"What about it?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">"You never talked to him. Hux I can't believe you wouldn't-"</p><p align="center">Hux was puzzled,<br/>
<strong>"When was this? Because I did enter his quarters around one in the morning."</strong></p><p align="center">Phasma became quiet.<br/>
Oh.<br/>
"...It was around midnight when he talked to me. I'm glad you actually did talk to him, because if you hadn't, I would have cross punched you until you did."</p><p align="center">Hux laughed,<br/>
<strong>"That sounds fun."</strong></p><p align="center">Phasma smiled beneath her mask, <br/>
Then she turned into curiosity.<br/>
"What did you tell him?"</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"That I was wrong."</strong>
</p><p align="center">"What did he do about it?"</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"He cried, as always."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Pity dribbled<br/>
Onto Phasma's face.<br/>
How could the General be so plain about<br/>
That?<br/>
Was he blind?<br/>
"General..."</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Hm?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">"I think that-"<br/>
Ren likes you.<br/>
"Nevermind."<br/>
He wouldn't have cried over something<br/>
Like that if he didn't.<br/>
You know what?<br/>
Hux could be hopeless all on his own.<br/>
He'll love Kylo when he's ready.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Captain, I don't understand the deal you're making out of this."</strong>
</p><p align="center">That comment caused one of<br/>
The General's peers to raise their voice<br/>
At him.<br/>
(It was the first time in history!)</p><p align="center">"You're so pathetic,"<br/>
Defiance!<br/>
"The deal I'm making is that you're in denial over your feelings for Ren. He cares about you Hux... So much that you brought him to tears, and don't persuade me otherwise because I've seen you with him. People who just <em>fuck</em> don't have a relationship like you and Ren. I've seen holofilms... They never do that. I can see the love pouring from your face General. You love touching him, you love kissing him, and you can't stand being apart from him. You're hopeless if you can't see any of that."</p><p align="center">Gaudiness drained from Hux as he<br/>
Shot Phasma a glare of disgust.<br/>
She stood, still as a rock,<br/>
Breathing heavy enough that he could<br/>
Hear it through the mask.</p><p align="center">He had no idea what to tell her.<br/>
He didn't even know where to start.</p><p align="center">Love was a word that sounded<br/>
So xenophobic to him.<br/>
It left Hux feeling vile, because<br/>
In all honesty,<br/>
Love was just as sweet as suicide.</p><p align="center">That's why loving Ren is nonexisent!</p><p align="center">It has to be!</p><p align="center">And before the foulness of his pretty face could infect his body,<br/>
Hux decided to abandon Phasma,<br/>
Disregarding the fact that he hadn't<br/>
Even replied.<br/>
(She even dared to mutter thee fact hat he truly was hopeless!)</p><p align="center">As he marched off the platform,<br/>
He caught attention of his flies.<br/>
They had cocooned themselves,<br/>
And molted into spiders<br/>
Far more colossal than he would ever be.<br/>
(I'm scared.)</p><p align="center">He tripped over his own feet as he<br/>
Escaped them.<br/>
Blood flowed to his face in mortification<br/>
As he regained posture,<br/>
(Oh, how frail he seemed!!!)<br/>
Taking notice to how the spiders had <br/>
Swiveled in their chairs,<br/>
Staring with blank faces as venom dripped<br/>
From bared chelicerae.<br/>
<em>And it was all for him. Delectable.  </em><br/>
(Who was the product of poor breeding<br/>
Now?)</p><p align="center">Hux saw himself in their eyes, multiplied.<br/>
And he saw the words that slithered<br/>
Off of Phasma's tongue<br/>
Which encircled his body in them:<br/>
Pathetic.</p><p align="center">He turned and walked.<br/>
The words followed him.<br/>
Pathetic <em>pathetic <strong>pathetic.</strong></em><br/>
It was the very word commonly used<br/>
To describe<br/>
Armitage.<br/>
Armitage was <em>that </em>freckle-faced<br/>
Vessel of a boy with an ugly name;<br/>
Which dread and imperfection indulged<br/>
To live inside of.<br/>
Poor Armitage no longer existed.<br/>
Hux fought and fought until Armitage finally<br/>
Took his last breath,<br/>
Killed him like Kylo killed his father.<br/>
He himself didn't want to die, and<br/>
That's why the fight was so hard. <br/>
(Make sure to tell papa I love him...<br/>
You're pathetic.<br/>
He doesn't love you, are you blind?)</p><p align="center">Hux's body jerked<br/>
As gravity made him it's victim<br/>
And pushed him too the floor.<br/>
But someone stopped it, along with<br/>
His feelings.</p><p align="center">Hux looked up.<br/>
Kylo?<br/>
Since when did he decide to appear?</p><p align="center"><em>"General?"</em> He asked.<br/>
Hux stared at him.<br/>
The mask didn't hide the pity.<br/>
This was horrible.<br/>
This was pathetic.<br/>
General Hux was scared again.<br/>
(But Kylo's warm arms...)<br/>
((It burned))</p><p align="center">Hux pulled himself from him,<br/>
Regained composure.<br/>
He was stoic again.<br/>
(Pathetically normal!)</p><p align="center">He brushed any sort of dust or mildew<br/>
That could have attached to his body during<br/>
His fall.<br/>
<strong>"Thank you, Ren."</strong></p><p align="center">Kylo stared at him,<br/>
Noticing his bite had almost<br/>
Completely healed.<br/>
<em>"You're welcome, General."</em><br/>
(Oh the normality it was agonizing)</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Why did you decide to come here?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"I felt better."</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Seems viable."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Soon, Hux<br/>
Walked passed him,<br/>
Making sure his left hand brushed over<br/>
Kylo's right.<br/>
<strong>"Meet me in my quarters tonight."</strong></p><p align="center">Kylo's stomach jolted.<br/>
Velvet was pouring again.</p>

    <p align="center">Hux didn't look like it, but he truly loved<br/> Jazz music.</p><p align="center">He liked artists with odd names<br/> That were too hard to pronounce.<br/> Because of that, he would sometimes<br/> Describe his taste in music as:</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>So good, it's out of this galaxy.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">When Kylo first arrived,<br/> The music was so loud that it seemed<br/> Hux only invited him to listen.</p><p align="center">The origin of the noise came from<br/> Hux's living room,<br/> Where he was pulling out a tea set<br/> From his china cabinet.<br/>Where Millicent was on his armchair,<br/>Hissing at Kylo.</p><p align="center">Hux cleared the cat off the chair,<br/> Allowing Kylo to sit as he prepared the tea.<br/> Kylo set his helmet on the floor next to<br/> Him,</p><p align="center">And even though they hadn't talked<br/> With the exception of a simple hello-<br/> The feeling of professionalism in the room<br/> Was very strange.</p><p align="center">Millicent came up to Kylo as Hux<br/> Started to boil water.<br/> He attempted to pet her,<br/> But all he received was a nasty scowl<br/> Accompanied by intense growling.</p><p align="center">Instead,<br/> Kylo sank into the depths of<br/> Hux's armchair,<br/> Relishing in the heat of the fireplace<br/> Burning behind him,<br/>Admiring Space outside Hux's monolithic<br/> Windows.<br/> The Jazz music still played like a ghost<br/> In the background:</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Though it's just a simple melody</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> with nothing fancy, nothing much</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> You could turn it to a symphony-</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> a Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch</strong>
</p><p align="center">Hux entered once again, poised,<br/> Carrying white china in his white china tray<br/> As steam escaped from the teapot spout.<br/> He placed it on the coffee table<br/> Between them,<br/> Slowly pouring a magenta liquid into<br/> One of the cups.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Oh! How my love song gently cries</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> for the tenderness within your eyes</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> My love is a prelude that never dies</strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong>"Do you like the song?"</strong> He asked.</p><p align="center"><em>"I do.</em>" Kylo said, receiving a soft smile<br/> From him.</p><p align="center">(Oh, how beautiful he was...)</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"It's one of my favorites."</strong>
</p><p align="center">He handed a cup to Kylo,<br/> And he accepted it with caution.<br/> Sipping the tea for the first time made<br/> His taste buds tickle at the sweetness.</p><p align="center"><em>"What flavor is this?"</em> He asked.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Hibiscus marmalade."</strong> Hux replied, relaxed.<br/> Sipping.<br/>Kylo couldn't help but down himself<br/> To the point of the liquid dripping to<br/> His chin.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Careful,</strong>" Hux said, getting up,<br/> Bending down,<br/> And casually sucking the tea off<br/> Kylo's chin,<br/> Soon to smooch him on the lips after, softly.</p><p align="center">Then he held onto him,<br/> Burying his head into his neck,<br/> Leaving Kylo speechless,<br/> Rocking him side to side.<br/> It took Kylo a moment to realize the<br/> Swings were in tempo with the song now.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Embrace me</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> My sweet embraceable you</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> Embrace me</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> My irreplaceable you</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> Just to look at you</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> My heart grows tipsy in me</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> You and you alone</strong>
</p><p align="center">After listening,<br/> Kylo soon started to rock himself with Hux.<br/>It was one of the calmest<br/> Sensations he had felt in a long time.<br/> (He could have even laid his head against<br/> Hux's and fallen asleep.)</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Come to me</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> Come to me do</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong> My sweet embraceable you.</strong>
</p><p align="center">When the song ended,<br/> It took Hux about the same time to<br/> Detach himself to Kylo as it did<br/> For him to attach in the first place.<br/> (And all balance was gone...)</p><p align="center">He was normal again.</p><p align="center">Professional again.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Have you had any luck finding Luke Skywalker?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">Kylo rubbed the back of his head,<br/> Reconciling in the heat that he didn't<br/> Want to leave him.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"I was thinking about canceling my plan."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux gave him a look of absolute perplexion.</p><p align="center"><strong>"What are you talking about?"</strong> he snapped,<br/><strong> "this was your goal from the start, and you just want to forget it?"</strong></p><p align="center">
  <em>"We've lost too much, Hux. You even said it yourself: there is no possible way we can obtain that map. Wherever the droid is, we know it's with that Rey girl. Wherever Rey is, is where the heart of the Resistance is too. It's just too risky, and Skywalker is probably dead anyways."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux sighed at him.</p><p align="center"><em>"Are you angry with me?"</em> Kylo asked.</p><p align="center">Ironically,<br/> As angry as Hux wanted to be,<br/> Something inside him just wasn't at all.</p><p align="center"><strong>"No."</strong> He told him, <strong>"It's not my decision; it is your's. But you realize Snoke will not be impressed by your actions?"</strong></p><p align="center"><em>"I know."</em> Kylo said. <em>"it doesn't matter to me. Not anymore."</em></p><p align="center">Hux raised his brows.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"I don't know what's gotten into you, Ren. You've changed since we attacked Orellius."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Kylo looked down,<br/> Petted the scar on his face.<br/> <em>"I don't know either."</em></p>

          <p>For those curious, the song the lyrics were derived from is called Embraceable You. Played it in my Jazz band once, and i became utterly enthralled by it the first time I heard it lmao.

    <p align="center">The music even echoed into the bathroom,<br/> Where Kylo's body laid on top of Hux<br/> Inside a lukewarm bathtub.</p><p align="center">Hux had his hands in Kylo's hair,<br/> Massaging and lathering shampoo into it.<br/> He washed the soap out after<br/> Raven hair had turned completely white,<br/> And relaxation<br/> Led Kylo to rest is head on Hux's chest.</p><p align="center">He was sheathed by his chin.<br/> Yes, Kylo was fully protected.</p><p align="center">Pale hands slid up and down Kylo's back<br/> As he held an<br/> Ear against Hux's heart.<br/> The beats matched with his own as<br/> They guided Kylo to sleep.<br/> Despite the music, and<br/> Despite the possibility of drowning,<br/> (Kylo knew Hux wouldn't let that happen<br/> Though.)<br/> His eyelids grew heavier and heavier until<br/> His vision became seduced by<br/> A temporary death.</p><p align="center">And although Kylo's eyes were off,<br/> His mind certainly wasn't.</p><p align="center">

  <em>"I was meditating and I felt you. You were terrified out of your mind and it concerned me. What happened?"</em>
</p><p align="center">All death was slain as Kylo's eyes opened<br/> From the uneasiness of Hux's<br/> Body.<br/> The Force made the sensation all<br/> Too real for him.</p><p align="center">
  <b>"Nothing happened, Ren. Besides, were you looking into my mind-?"</b>

  <em>"No I wasn't! And I know you're lying to me, it felt like you were pleading with someone to save you."</em>

  <em>"Armitage..."</em>

  <em>"...okay, <b>Hux</b>. Does that name have anything to do with why you were scared?"</em>

Actually, I don't know where she is. So maybe, she could be dead."</b></p><p align="center"><em>"What do you mean?"</em><br/> He asked.</p><p align="center"><b>"I was born in illegitimacy. My father was the one who kept me. Kylo, I'm as useless as a paper boat.

Your father hurt you, and I've been down that road so many times... Sometimes all you have to do is..."</em><br/> He began to recline himself against Hux's<br/> Body,<br/> Head gluing to his chest again,<br/><em> "...lay down and</em><br/> Relax it out."<br/> Hearts slowed, allowing the serenity of<br/> Nothing<br/> To take power.</p><p align="center"><em>"You're beautiful, Armitage Hux,"</em><br/> He said,<br/><em> "Everything about you is beautiful. Don't let your father trick you into thinking that you're not."</em></p><p align="center">Hux took a deep breath,<br/> And leaned his head over the edge of the<br/> Bathtub.<br/> He had no idea what was becoming of him.<br/> But something about it,<br/> Something about the everlasting feeling of<br/> Compassion that Kylo was just <em>giving</em><br/> To him,<br/> And the eternal blankness surrounding them<br/> Made him feel<br/> Not prideful, but<br/> Happy.</p><p align="center">
  <b>"I think you're beautiful too."</b>
</p><p align="center">Kylo laughed,<br/><em> "I'm not, I'm really not."</em><br/> (Then why did you tell me I was?)</p><p align="center">
  <b>"Why?"</b>
</p><p align="center"><em>"Because of my scar. It's made me into a deformed person."</em><br/> (Oh, Kylo.)</p><p align="center">Hux brushed the hair from Kylo's face,<br/> Took him by the chin and gently<br/> Caressed his porcelain lips with his own,<br/> Sliding from the tip of the scar,<br/> Down to Kylo's bony shoulder blades.<br/> And in the most doting tone he ever<br/> Talked in,<br/> (The sugar of it turned even his own<br/> Guts into puddles)<br/> he said,<br/><b> "I think you're prettier than a deformed person."</b></p><p align="center">Jazz music consumed them.</p>

And feed it to the dogs next!)</p><p align="center">Screams became constricted<br/> When moldy yellow vomit dripped from<br/> Under the helmet.</p><p align="center">Hux could only stare, petrified.</p><p align="center">When Kylo inserted his lightsaber into<br/> The burning arm,<br/> That's when Father tried to grab him.<br/> His hand devoured Kylo and<br/> Forced him off his rocker.</p><p align="center">His screams became lightning to Hux<br/> As he swung the lightsaber in any<br/> Direction possible.<br/> Hux tried to protect himself by stepping<br/> Away,<br/> Watching in horror.</p><p align="center">Kylo looked at Father.<br/> Oh, he was gonna get it.<br/> Father was going to die again.</p><p align="center">Sweat dripped from his forehead,<br/> And he laughed out to him as he<br/> Impaled the body in the chest.<br/> Nice and slow enough to capture<br/> Every moment of death that took Father.</p><p align="center">But that wasn't enough.<br/> <em>"Why aren't you falling down??"</em> Kylo asked.<br/> <strong><em>"Why aren't you falling down?"</em></strong><br/> He impaled the body again.<br/> Blood mixed with the vomit and<br/> Squirted out, embracing him more<br/> Than Hux ever could.</p><p align="center">Tears covered his face<br/> As he shook and pierced the chest more.<br/> <em>"Why won't you die?"</em> he wailed<br/> At father.<br/> (Why?!?!)</p><p align="center">He took to the left arm, then the right,<br/> Decapitating them both clean off and then<br/> Chopping up the rest of the the body until<br/> It became a red and brown mush.</p><p align="center">Father still didn't die,<br/> He was making that horrible scar burn now,<br/> And Kylo cried even more.<br/> <em>"Why do you hate me?"</em> He wailed again,<br/> Hyperventilating and coughing,<br/> Trying to take a swing at the gore pudding<br/> Again,<br/> But only turning the lightsaber off.</p><p align="center">Realizing the chance he had been given,<br/> Hux ran and grabbed Kylo,<br/> And he shrieked at the touch as if<br/> The General were legitimately hurting him.</p><p align="center">He thrashed and kicked,<br/> Slipping on blood until they fell backwards.</p><p align="center"><em>"He doesn't go away..."</em> Kylo wailed,<br/> <em>"I just want him to stop torturing me..."</em><br/> He turned to look behind him.<br/> Father was still waiting for him there<br/> And he became filled with horror again.<br/> His vocal chords were becoming raw now,<br/> And he turned the lightsaber back on,<br/> Placed it in line with his head.</p><p align="center">Hux tried to break his arm to take the<br/> Weapon.<br/> <strong>"Kylo, stop."</strong><br/> He snatched it from him, turned it off,<br/> Placed it inside his coat.</p><p align="center">Kylo pawed at him,<br/> Pleading with him to let him do this.<br/> Let him end himself because <em>being</em><br/><em> Tormented by Father was far worse than</em><br/><em> Death!!!!!</em></p><p align="center">Hux's face was reduced to nothing but pure<br/> Melancholy by then.<br/> Pitiful, He told Kylo he wouldn't allow him<br/> To do it.<br/> Then he rocked him,<br/> Whispered all the things into his ear that<br/> Made him feel good.</p><p align="center">

  <strong>"Is what true?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">"I heard that the Resistance eradicated your Star Destroyer. Is it true?"</p><p align="center">Hux's eyebrows furrowed.</p><p align="center">"There's no point in lying to me because if you do, I'll find out the truth anyways."</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center">"...And it all went to waste less than a week after it was officially operational?"</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Yes Papa."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Kylo heard the hologram fall to its knees.<br/> "The only time you made me think twice about... The only thing that made me proud of you... It doesn't exist anymore."</p><p align="center">Kylo looked at Hux,<br/> He could tell he was panicking.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Papa, oh Papa, wait- please wait I'll make you proud again-"</strong>
</p><p align="center">"Make me proud again? It all came down to this, Armitage! This was your destiny, and it's just GONE. How could you have let that happen? Are you sure you haven't been diagnosed with a sort of disorder??? Because no bastard child I have ever heard of has failed as bad as you. You have disgraced our family name, do you hear me, Armitage Hux??? Had I not ravished your mother, none of this would have happened, because you wouldn't have existed, so you wouldn't have had all the undesirable genes. Pathetic!!"</p><p align="center">((Pathetic!!))</p><p align="center">Tears were crawling down his father's eyes.</p><p align="center">But Hux just stood wide eyed.</p><p align="center">"Why did you let that happen??? Why Armitage?!? Why why why??"<br/> And he pleaded and pleaded until his lungs started to give out.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Papa... I can't help what genes I received. I still have a part of you in my blood..."</strong>
</p><p align="center">His father quieted, then frowned,<br/> "...I wish I wasn't in your blood at all."<br/> With that,<br/> He left the call.</p><p align="center">Kylo ran to his partner,<br/> Held his arm and asked if he were okay.</p><p align="center">Hux just tugged away violently,<br/> Said he was fine,<br/> And left for bed.</p><p align="center">Kylo decided to get in it too,<br/> Stared at the ceiling until Hux had<br/> Fallen asleep peacefully.</p><p align="center">Then, Kylo leaned to his side and<br/> Petted his head,<br/> Filling it with happy dreams,<br/> Afraid that his father would have even<br/> Haunted him there.</p>

    <p align="center">On behalf of Lieutenant Mitaka,<br/>
Hux was escorted to the most<br/>
Horrific<br/>
Area of The Finalizer:</p><p align="center">It was Hux's very own<br/>
Personal oubliette.<br/>
Given with the blessing of<br/>
Super Leader Snoke,</p><p align="center">He knew Kylo didn't know of its existence;<br/>
Maybe it was better that way<br/>
Because<br/>
He'd be lying if it weren't a utopia to him<br/>
At some point.<br/>
It used to derive him power far better than<br/>
Any contorted form of sex he ever had.</p><p align="center">It was solely because<br/>
It made him cold again when he felt warm.<br/>
Poor man killed to lose humanity.<br/>
But<br/>
It turned him into the man Papa wanted<br/>
And that's all that mattered.<br/>
(Oh, does he wish the area never existed.)<br/>
(He wish he never existed.)<br/>
(Papa you were right.)</p><p align="center">Hux dared to tremble within himself<br/>
As Mitaka pulled that rug in the storage<br/>
Room.<br/>
Like a bride,<br/>
He unveiled Heaven's tarnished gates,<br/>
And Hux nearly died.</p><p align="center">Slowly, Mitaka opened it for his General,<br/>
(Little was he aware that Hux wasn't<br/>
Prepared oh no he wasn't he wasn't ready<br/>
At all for this!)<br/>
Beckoned him over when it had opened.<br/>
There, they descended into that once<br/>
Most beautiful<br/>
Hell-room.</p><p align="center">The very beginning was the overseer's<br/>
Room,<br/>
Which was filled with security cameras<br/>
Of each dungeon.<br/>
They had yet to even reach the dungeon<br/>
Itself,<br/>
And Hux could already smell that pungent odor of<br/>
Maggot-meat.<br/>
The Lieutenant tried not to show it,<br/>
But there was clear disgust on his face<br/>
From it<br/>
Too.</p><p align="center">Hux leaned over to the cameras,<br/>
And witnessed what he had done<br/>
In each cell<br/>
From so long ago.<br/>
Switching from camera to camera,<br/>
He saw his reality.</p><p align="center">He was a blasphemy.<br/>
An absolute disgrace to the face of God<br/>
ESPECIALLY when he was one of the<br/>
Only people left on that horrific Finalizer<br/>
That still cradled their very own mortality.</p><p align="center">Years ago,<br/>
A prisoner came down with an unknown<br/>
Sickness.<br/>
Now, that prisoner is a skeleton,<br/>
Black from the dead tissue stuck to him<br/>
And<br/>
The brown vomit he threw up every day<br/>
Was still crusted to the floor.</p><p align="center">A mother and her child,<br/>
Both raped and stabbed to death by<br/>
His comrades,<br/>
Remained as rotting corpses in a single<br/>
Corner for mice to eat.<br/>
In fact, the mice had eaten the mother<br/>
So ravenously,<br/>
(Like pigs!)<br/>
That there was a blood encrusted hole<br/>
Where the womb and pelvis<br/>
Should be.<br/>
Untouched and pink,<br/>
Hux noticed the head of a fetus<br/>
Popping out from the hole.<br/>
It was dead.<br/>
It was most certainly dead.<br/>
But it begged Hux to save it.</p><p align="center">For the first time ever,<br/>
And to his horror,<br/>
Hux could sympathize with the grief Kylo<br/>
Held<br/>
For the Orellian baby.</p><p align="center">He wanted to stop.<br/>
Turn off the cameras and claw his eyes out<br/>
Till he bled out, became blind, and died<br/>
But</p><p align="center">He decided to look at one more, out of<em> sheer curiosity-</em><br/>
And the image from it<br/>
Would probably never leave him.</p><p align="center">In the very last room,<br/>
A man hung himself from the ceiling.<br/>
His body somehow was refusing to decay,<br/>
So it stayed just as did on the day he<br/>
Actually did kill himself.<br/>
In a way,<br/>
However,<br/>
He still seemed alive.</p><p align="center">Hux walked back and covered his face.<br/>
That energy was supernatural<br/>
And kicked at his stomach.<br/>
It was probably their ghosts<br/>
And they knew<br/>
He was the man credited with the atrocities<br/>
Done to them.<br/>
Papa would be proud.</p><p align="center">Mitaka switched to the next camera,<br/>
And on the other side of the hanging man,<br/>
Was the Orellian woman.<br/>
...And she was scared.</p><p align="center">Tediously,<br/>
Hux composed himself again.</p><p align="center"><strong>"What was the reason behind interrogating her again?"</strong> He asked.</p><p align="center">Mitaka shuffled to him,<br/>
Almost dumbfounded as he did so.<br/>
"She could be a Resistance Rat."</p><p align="center">With that,<br/>
Hux took precious time to look twice<br/>
When examining her,<br/>
Then he looked back to the Lieutenant.<br/>
<strong>"How can you be so sure?? Were you there on Orellius when we even attacked??</strong><br/>
<strong> Because if you were, you should have clearly seen that those natives were</strong><br/>
<strong> Millenniums behind to our basic technology. There wasn't even a single report of a</strong><br/>
<strong> Resistance post or emblem."</strong></p><p align="center">Mitaka frowned,<br/>
"And?? The Resistance consists of a force of cunning bastards. Are you going to let that mislead you?"</p><p align="center">Hux hesitated, opened his mouth,<br/>
Then hesitated again.<br/>
What would papa do?</p><p align="center">(At night the boy cries when the<br/>
Moon shines nigh for<br/>
Papa couldn't untie his life from his eyes<br/>
Which were the eyes everyone<br/>
Could spy on<br/>
Except him<br/>
Because Freedom isn't Freedom<br/>
Without the sly Hell that has to be<br/>
Paid for<br/>
Yes oh yes that was<br/>
Death to him.)</p><p align="center">Lieutenant Mitaka stared at him as if<br/>
He really were dead.<br/>
"...General?"</p><p align="center">Hux popped from his state and<br/>
Looked at him.<br/>
<strong>"I'm ready to interrogate her, Lieutenant. What are you waiting for?"</strong><br/>
(Yes make it look like it was his fault)</p><p align="center">Mitaka nodded,<br/>
And opened the door.<br/>
Decades-old air brushed into Hux's face,<br/>
Along with the putrid smell of corpses<br/>
That nearly made him bend over gagging.<br/>
Instead, he focused on the girl<br/>
Passing by memories that he didn't<br/>
Want to relive.</p><p align="center">The two men stopped at her cell,<br/>
And she screamed when they opened<br/>
The door.<br/>
Hux stayed behind him,<br/>
But straight away Mitaka pinned her neck<br/>
Against the wall.</p><p align="center">"Are you in the Resistance?"<br/>
He demanded.<br/>
She cried; she didn't answer.<br/>
So he repeated himself.<br/>
"Are you in the Resistance?"<br/>
Same outcome.</p><p align="center">Mitaka held his hand out<br/>
In that fist,<br/>
And it shook.<br/>
It was going straight on her face.</p><p align="center"><strong>"-Lieutenant!"</strong> Hux commanded.</p><p align="center">Mitaka stopped, and looked at him.<br/>
"Yes, General?"</p><p align="center"><strong>"Move out of the way."</strong><br/>
And he shoved him over,<br/>
<strong>"I'm going to see if I can do anything."</strong></p><p align="center">Hux knelt down,<br/>
Took her hand,<br/>
And tried his best to watch her with<br/>
The same eyes he uses to watch Kylo.</p><p align="center">She may have actually calmed down<br/>
From it.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Are you in the Resistance?"</strong> He asked.<br/>
She only blabbered gibberish.</p><p align="center">Hux turned to the Lieutenant,<br/>
<strong>"I don't think she knows what I'm saying."</strong></p><p align="center">Mitaka knelt down next to him<br/>
Stared at the girl dead in the eyes.<br/>
Thus, he concluded:<br/>
"It's a show. Even Supreme Leader Snoke wouldn't be fooled."</p><p align="center">Hux looked at him, and hesitated again.<br/>
So he asked her again<br/>
(For Mitaka's sake)<br/>
And she didn't reply.</p><p align="center">When she did speak,<br/>
It was never in the Galatic Basic,<br/>
And when asked if she knew the language,<br/>
She wouldn't do a single thing about it.<br/>
She would just stare at them both<br/>
Fish eyed,<br/>
And speak gibberish again.<br/>
It vexed them both,<br/>
So Hux ordered Mitaka to restrain her.</p><p align="center">She started to scream again when<br/>
Mitaka pinned her wrists to the wall.<br/>
But no matter the screaming,<br/>
No matter now raucous or<br/>
Throat-rawing it was,<br/>
An answer would never come out.</p><p align="center"><strong>"How <em>pathetic.</em>"</strong> Hux scoffed.</p><p align="center">The Lieutenant smirked,<br/>
And Hux moved his face closer with her<br/>
Own.<br/>
It made him uncomfortable.</p><p align="center"><strong>"How does it feel to be inferior?"</strong><br/>
He prodded her,<br/>
<strong>"How does it feel to be too weak? To be asked something that you can't understand? Does it feel fair? Does it feel righteous? Because I swear to you that we feel the same way considering we can't understand a single word you say. I know someone, his name is Armitage, and he's just like you: <em>Pathetic,</em> infantile, and pure..."</strong></p><p align="center">She spat in his face.<br/>
Hux sighed, and wiped it off.<br/>
<strong>"Get the device, Mitaka. I've got her."</strong></p><p align="center">So Hux took her hands<br/>
As the Lieutenant left to get it.</p><p align="center">It was the sad device.<br/>
The scary device.<br/>
But it was also the least lethal,<br/>
Which made him furrow his eyebrows at<br/>
Her.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Can't you see I'm trying to help you?!?"</strong><br/>
He asked.<br/>
<strong>"If this really is a show, which I doubt, why don't you speak up?!?!? I'll make sure you'll be okay-"</strong></p><p align="center">The Lieutenant came back in just<br/>
As she was going to open her mouth.<br/>
It cackled with him.</p><p align="center">"I think we should put her in the room."<br/>
He said.</p><p align="center">Hux agreed.<br/>
The room was just as scary as<br/>
The device.<br/>
All It contained was a single chair,<br/>
Full of meshes to refrain any desired part<br/>
Of the body.<br/>
Primarily used for water torture,<br/>
The chair could be used on her too<br/>
As she received the device.</p><p align="center">So as she was escorted,<br/>
She shrieked and tried to jerk away from<br/>
Hux madly,<br/>
Like a frenetic alley dog being pulled<br/>
Into the pound.<br/>
Of course Lieutenant Mitaka asked if he<br/>
Needed help, but Hux said<br/>
He was fine,<br/>
And that someone needed to carry the<br/>
Device.</p><p align="center">When they approached the room,<br/>
Mitaka quickly put the device down and<br/>
Aided Hux in tying her down into the chair.<br/>
They tied every part of her body except her<br/>
Left arm.</p><p align="center">That's when she knew she was<br/>
Stuck in the spider's web.</p><p align="center">When Hux inserted her hand into the<br/>
Device,<br/>
She jerked her arm away.</p><p align="center">She had her entire arm tied down for that.</p><p align="center">Try two and she could not move.<br/>
And the Lieutenant was infatuated<br/>
With the pain.</p><p align="center">Hux had sympathy on his face through<br/>
It all,<br/>
Like a doctor preforming surgery on a<br/>
Patient without anesthesia.</p><p align="center">He begged and forced and pleaded with her<br/>
To spill her guts with truth,<br/>
But like any nonbeliever to God,<br/>
She did not repent.</p><p align="center">So Hux twisted the crank more,<br/>
And Her fingers popped louder.</p><p align="center">Mitaka was smiling maniacally at her for it.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Does this turn you on Lieutenant?"</strong><br/>
Hux asked.<br/>
How repulsive his men were!<br/>
(And how dare it make the General laugh!)</p><p align="center">"It does."<br/>
His Lieutenant said.<br/>
How could someone be so Sadistic?</p><p align="center"><strong>"Dirty dog."</strong><br/>
He sneered,<br/>
<strong>"Are you going to touch yourself tonight now?"</strong></p><p align="center">The Lieutenant smirked,<br/>
"I may just do it right now. You may join in if you want to, General."</p><p align="center">How foul he is!<br/>
<strong>"Dare you even do that in front of me,"</strong><br/>
Hux said,<br/>
<strong>"I'll have it be seen that you are demoted to Sargeant."</strong></p><p align="center">The Lieutenant scoffed at the remark.</p><p align="center">The woman was howling.<br/>
Swollen and bleeding,<br/>
Her fingers looked more like broken<br/>
Flower stems<br/>
Rather than<br/>
Actual fingers.<br/>
...And Hux couldn't twist anymore.<br/>
Her fingers were just flat beneath the<br/>
Device.<br/>
Mitaka only laughed.</p><p align="center">She was crying, talking in her language<br/>
Again,<br/>
More than likely begging Hux to stop.</p><p align="center">His eyes deepened in her enough that<br/>
He knew she felt the connection.<br/>
And as if instinctively,<br/>
Hux looked up at the Lieutenant.<br/>
<strong>"This was useless; this woman is not with the Resistance. She's far too fragile."</strong></p><p align="center">"That's what the resistance wants you to think," Mitaka said, "I thought you would know better, General."</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"I do know better, Lieutenant. So you better heed my command. Your conspicuous propaganda-driven paranoia ends now. If she were in the Resistance, she would understand us. If she were in the Resistance, she wouldn't be dressed like a native. If she were in the Resistance, she would have spoken up. She probably saw soldiers running out of a transport carrier, and as in an act of defending her planet, she probably ran inside to fight. She doesn't deserve this."</strong>
</p><p align="center">"What would Supreme Leader say?"<br/>
Mitaka snapped.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Supreme Leader cannot do anything. I am in charge until his arrival, therefore I am your Supreme Leader now. What we have done to this woman was completely barbaric, so I say we let her go."</strong>
</p><p align="center">The ire was bland the within the<br/>
Lieutenant's eyes.<br/>
"You are not Snoke, General Hux. Your power has absolutely corrupted you."</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"In what way am I corrupted?!? I'm simply using rationale, for we have no evidence proving she is with the Resistance. You just want her dead for sexual gratification, which is absolutely vile. You can go find a woman anywhere! And one that'll consent to you hurting her!"</strong>
</p><p align="center">Mitaka held his blaster out at her.<br/>
She gasped,<br/>
And Hux lunged for him,<br/>
Pushing the gun to the other side of the<br/>
Room,<br/>
And grabbing the Lieutenant by his neck,<br/>
Pushing him against the wall.</p><p align="center">He hit it with an immense thud.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Dare you EVER do contrary to my command,"</strong><br/>
Hux began,<br/>
<strong>"I WILL have it seen that you are either deported or terminated. I am your Superior, therefore you DO NOT disobey me. Do I make myself clear, Lieutenant?"</strong></p><p align="center">Mitaka's throat was writhing beneath<br/>
Hux's hand, screaming.<br/>
And as he choked,<br/>
He started to murmur:<br/>
"Yes. You swine."</p><p align="center">Now, Hux was upset.<br/>
He gripped the Lieutenant's throat<br/>
With further pressure.<br/>
Possessed, he watched as the life<br/>
In his hands turned purple.<br/>
But,<br/>
That wave of guilt hit him,<br/>
( as always )<br/>
So he let go.<br/>
(Oh, he had to.)</p><p align="center">Mitaka nearly dropped to the floor,<br/>
Took a long second to breathe and<br/>
Let the color come back to his face.<br/>
After that, he composed himself,<br/>
And without saying a word to the General,<br/>
He left.</p><p align="center">Now<br/>
Hux was alone with the woman.<br/>
He undid the meshes.</p>

But I don't come here anymore. I only come here to interrogate someone like in this instance. It's the only place I could have interrogated her. How did you get here anyways?"</strong></p><p align="center">Sorrow took Kylo's face,<br/> And he said,<br/> <em>"I felt you in distress again. I asked where you were and the Colonel said you were here."</em></p><p align="center">(Oh Kylo please stop worrying about me it'll get me in trouble one day if it hasn't already-)</p><p align="center">Then his attention moved to the camera<br/> Screen.<br/> He started flipping,<br/> Looking through every cell.<br/> He saw the sleeping Orellian woman,<br/> The black skeleton with the heap on the<br/> Floor<br/> That he didn't know was vomit.<br/> He was horrified by the hanging body,<br/> But when he saw the<br/> Mother, fetus, and child,<br/> He covered his mouth and completely<br/> Broke down crying.<br/> The crying turned into gagging,<br/> And the gagging turned to bile at the<br/> Corner of the room.</p><p align="center">Hux wanted to die.<br/> His lips trembled as his arm reached<br/> For his(?) Kylo:<br/> Curled up and facing the wall,<br/> Mourning lives he didn't know.</p><p align="center"><em>"What is this?"</em> He sobbed,<br/> <strong><em>"What is this??"</em></strong></p><p align="center">When Hux touched his shoulder,<br/> Kylo screamed as if he had been<br/>Stabbed.<br/> The scream nearly sent Hux into paralysis.</p><p align="center"><em>"TELL ME!"</em> Kylo pleaded,<br/><em> "WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE PEOPLE?!"</em></p><p align="center">Hux struggled to take a deep breath,<br/> Let alone breathe at all,<br/> But he answered him.<br/> <strong>"You know who the Orellian Woman is. The Hanging man is self-explanatory, the skeleton was a man who got sick, and the mother and child were raped and killed by my men. I had nothing to do with it, but I took the credit for their murders to make my father happy. Surely you have to understand-"</strong></p><p align="center">Kylo turned to face him,<br/> <em>"What I don't understand is why you broke that woman's fingers and healed them afterwards?? What were you trying to do Hux?"</em></p><p align="center"><strong>"Did you not listen to the video?!? And what I told her??"</strong><br/> He asked,<br/> <strong>"The reason why I used the Tean Zu was because I knew that wouldn't kill her! And with proper medical attention, she would be healed..."</strong></p><p align="center">And he almost killed himself for saying it:</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"I'm not my father's slave anymore, and surely you could see that. Lieutenant Mitaka acted like a robot in there. I did not. For once, I was thinking about what you've been saying to me. How could I not after seeing that fetus in the mother's stomach?!?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">He took another breath,<br/> But he could not speak.<br/> Kylo was just flabbergasted by all<br/> Hux has said.<br/> (He wasn't talking to a tree this whole time!<br/> The tree hears!)</p><p align="center">But</p><p align="center">Another thing piqued within him.<br/> (His) Hux was on the floor,<br/> Weeping.</p><p align="center">Kylo tilted his head with utmost<br/> Childlike curiosity.<br/> He knelt down on the floor<br/> In front of the General,  <br/> And inquired what was wrong for<br/> He had never seen him<br/> Cry before.</p><p align="center">General Hux looked up at his Kylo,<br/> Eyes were red and puffy,<br/> and he started to weep again<br/> as he said:</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"I saw death in your eyes, and I was scared because I thought you would never want to see me again- and I can't do that! Can't you see, Kylo Ren?!? Are you blind?!? Because I love you! I love you with every part of my heart that still beats within me! I always have! And you never saw! You never ever did!"</strong>
</p><p align="center">Kylo's heart shrieked.<br/> It imploded within itself<br/> As his brain screamed and convulsed<br/> And begged<br/> For his body to react.<br/> And when it did,</p><p align="center">He only let out a howl as his eyes<br/> Began to rain all over his cheeks as<br/> He too confessed his love for his General. </p><p align="center">They didn't even talk;<br/> They just intertwined within each other,<br/> And became like crumpled up blankets:<br/> Rolling all over the floor,<br/> Only aware of each other's existence<br/> And the warmth it gave.</p><p align="center">The kisses felt unreal that night.</p>

<p align="center">She was still asleep, but shuffled as Hux<br/> Touched her.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>"What do we do with her?"</strong> He asked.</p>

<p align="center">The reponse was far too idealistic,<br/> But<br/> Hux nodded, then looked back at the body.<br/> He clapped his hands next to her and<br/> Fiddled with her eyelids.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>"Can you hear me?"</strong> He asked her.</p>
<p align="center">Her eyes opened slowly,<br/>Then her body jolted violently<br/>As<br/> She recognized him.</p>
<p align="center">She looked at Kylo too, and then<br/> At her hands.<br/> She furrowed her eyebrows;<br/> Looked at Hux with clear perplexion.</p>
<p align="center">He only kissed her cheek in response,<br/> And left her to think as he and Kylo left.<br/> (And of course, he made sure to lock<br/> The door.)</p>

We are all controlled, if we weren't, we wouldn't be fighting as we are, using our fear of Snoke as our primary function, rather than moral standards.

  <strong>"I'm gonna do everything it takes to avenge that woman Kylo just wait just wait I'm going to do what I want I'm gonna let papa know that I'm a man and I can make good decisions based on my natural human morality- not because I was taught, but because it want to give a fuck about something for once in my life, Kylo, just you watch and see I'm gonna take Mitaka and make him regret defying me ever again-"</strong>
</p><p align="center">It only took a single kick to break<br/> The lock off<br/> The Lieutenant's door.</p><p align="center"><strong>"DOPHELD MITAKA."</strong> He roared.<br/> The sound waves nearly pushed<br/> The Lieutenant off his chair.</p><p align="center">Powerless, Kylo only watched<br/> As they quarreled.</p><p align="center">Straight away, the General pulled his<br/> Blaster.<br/> Lieutenant Mitaka gasped, and shuffled<br/> Around his pockets for his own,<br/> But there was only emptiness.</p><p align="center"><strong>"You ape!"</strong> He howled.<br/> The Blaster trembled at Mitaka's temple.<br/> <strong>"How dare you disobey my orders!

  <em>Groin.</em>
</p><p align="center">Nerves piqued within the Lieutenant,<br/> And his thighs begged for mercy.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Why did you do it, Mitaka?"</strong><br/> The General whispered,<br/> Nearly caressing the Lieutenant's ear<br/> With his lips.</p><p align="center">"She was very beautiful,"<br/> He answered,<br/> Voice shaking.<br/> "How could I not have done that to her?

  <em>"What is it? (My Love)"</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Can you search his desk for a blaster? I would do it myself if I could."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Kylo nodded, and searched through it.<br/> He checked under piles of papers,<br/> And through drawers<br/> Until he found something entirely more<br/>Sinister.</p><p align="center"><em>"Armitage..."</em> he said,<br/> <em>"I think you want to look at this."</em></p><p align="center">Ignoring the Lieutenant's inquiry,<br/> Asking if his first name really was Armitage,<br/> Hux approached Kylo.<br/>In his hand<br/> Were a series of photos, which he<br/> Stared bug eyed at.</p><p align="center">Hux took them,<br/> And nearly vomited.<br/> Mitaka smirked at the reaction.<br/> <strong>"You Necrophile!"</strong> Hux yelled.</p><p align="center">Shuffling through photos,<br/> Each one contained corpses of dead<br/> Women.<br/> They were<br/> Horribly mutilated.<br/> Some were rotten and wearing lingerie<br/> And then<br/> Some of them, the Lieutenant was in.<br/> He was either penetrating them<br/> Or kissing them violently.</p><p align="center">The General covered his mouth over them.<br/> (-And General Hux never covers his mouth<br/> Over anything.)<br/> <strong>"Mitaka, you are mad?! Did you kill all these women? What deranged form of satisfaction do you get from this?!?"</strong></p><p align="center">The Lieutenant was pale now,<br/> But still smirking.<br/> His veins were more prominent than<br/> The pink on his lips and<br/> His eyes were losing their<br/> Glitter.<br/> Thus he took one of his last<br/> Breaths,<br/> And said:</p><p align="center">"Death has a sensual kind of beauty to it that you'll never understand, Armitage Hux. Weak boy. I do pity you."</p><p align="center">And just like that</p><p align="center">A human life was gone.</p><p align="center">Like blowing out a candle flame,<br/> Lieutenant Mitaka became the universe,<br/> And the universe bled out him.</p><p align="center">Kylo watched in horror,<br/> Paranoid father was going to<br/> Appear any second,<br/> But he snapped when he felt his<br/> Helmet being pulled off by his lover,<br/> Being pulled into his embrace.<br/> His helmet dropped to the floor,<br/> But he didn't notice the noise within Hux's<br/> Heartbeat.</p><p align="center">Hux rocked him as he began to shake.<br/> <strong>"You're okay."</strong> Hux reassured him,<br/> <strong>"I know what your scared of, and he's not here. You're okay."</strong></p><p align="center">And as if forgetting what even<br/> Happened,<br/> Kylo tried to pry off of Hux to ask:<br/> <em>"What are you gonna do with the body?"</em></p><p align="center">Hux wouldn't let him go.<br/> <strong>"I'm gonna leave it here."</strong> He replied,<br/> And spat at the corpse,<br/> <strong>"Nobody's going to want to talk to him anyways."</strong></p><p align="center">So Kylo picked up his helmet,<br/> And with his hand in Hux's, they left;<br/> The deed was done.<br/> And as they did leave,<br/> Kylo turned around<br/> One<br/> More<br/> Time<br/> Just to look at Mitaka's dead body.</p><p align="center">It was then<br/> With all of its gruesomeness<br/> That Kylo knew:</p><p align="center">No matter how tranquil Hux may become,<br/> His past algorithms with forever<br/> Be stains on him.</p><p align="center">But,<br/> Maybe that ideology was faulty.<br/> This was only a retribution.</p>

  <em>
    <strong>"...And I assume much has been amended since then?"</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">Kylo and Hux nodded their heads,<br/> Almost on tempo.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"What have either of you done?"</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong>"I've exterminated any inadequate stormtrooper that has come to my attention,"</strong><br/> Hux said,<br/> <strong>"And I planned ambushes against enemy planets."</strong></p><p align="center">Snoke nodded.<br/> It was obvious he was impressed.</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"What about you, Kylo Ren?"</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center"><em>"I disciplined those whose thoughts didn't agree with us,"</em><br/> And he gestured his arm to Hux,<br/> Who looked at him with opened-eyes.<br/> (What an anomaly he was!<br/> Telling half-lies straight to the face of<br/> The man he obeyed for so long!)</p><p align="center">Snoke only nodded further.</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"Do you know why I am here?"</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">Kylo began to clear his throat, but Hux<br/> Answered the inquiry faster,<br/> <strong>"It's my fault."</strong><br/> He stated,<br/> <strong>"I created Star Destroyer, which was too ambitious of an idea. It was destroyed by the Resistance the day it was first used. It was entirely my fault."</strong></p><p align="center">Snoke, impressed by such responsibility,<br/> Raised his browbones.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"Indeed it was your fault. Do you know how you could have prevented its collapse?"</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong>"My Colonels and I should have taken the proper precautionary measures that would have predetermined the objective of the Resistance, thus ensuring our victory."</strong><br/> A shaky hand ran through his hair,<br/> <strong>"I was too vain in my own pride and gluttony to even realize it. I apologize."</strong></p><p align="center">Snoke clocked his head over too Kylo,<br/> <em><strong>"You're not entirely innocent either, Ren."</strong></em></p><p align="center"><em>"What did I do?"</em> He asked.</p><p align="center"><em><strong>"Why don't you think about that revolting scar that's across your face? Let that answer it for you?"</strong></em><br/> (Hux always told him he was still pretty<br/> With it. Was he wrong? Was he wrong?<br/> Was he wrong?)</p><p align="center">Kylo touched it<br/> And he let out a cry.<br/> It was physically singeing and<br/> He didn't know what to do.<br/> It was as if he had been gashed in<br/> The head<br/> With Rey's damned lightsaber all over again.</p><p align="center">All he could do was let his<br/> Body convulse and tremor to the pain,<br/> Rubbing his face profusely<br/> And hyperventilating at (his) Hux,<br/> Looking at him constantly<br/> Like a cry for help.</p><p align="center">Hux only watched him gravely,<br/> And stayed a statue.<br/> Kylo didn't ask for help either.<br/> (Snoke couldn't know no he couldn't...)</p><p align="center"><em>"What's wrong with it?!?"</em><br/> He screamed,<br/> And the pain stopped.</p><p align="center">After he had established (his) Kylo<br/> Was okay,<br/> Hux looked at his Superior with all<br/> Fire<br/> In his eyes.<br/> (How dare that monster hurt HIS Kylo!)<br/> Apprehension was a demon here.</p><p align="center"><em><strong>"You didn't kill the girl."</strong></em> Snoke said.</p><p align="center">Kylo's face looked completely unharmed,<br/> Despite the ghost of pain he<br/> Was still trying to rub off.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Rey was too strong, Supreme leader. Her power was too palpable. You don't understand- I really tried-"</em>
</p><p align="center"><em><strong>"I don't understand?!"</strong> </em>He yelled,<br/> <strong><em>"I shouldn't be hearing such an answer from MY apprentice. Did you even train during my absence?"</em></strong></p><p align="center">Kylo didn't respond. Snoke frowned.</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"You hadn't?"</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">Kylo nodded.</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"Do you know why?"</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">Because of Hux.<br/> <em>"No."</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"I think I know why."</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center"><em>"hm?"</em> </p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"You were too preoccupied with your tryst with General Hux."</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">Kylo and Hux both widened their eyes<br/> And looked at each other.<br/> <strong>'Did you somehow tell him?'</strong> Hux mouthed.<br/> Kylo shook his head,<br/> So Hux intervened.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Why would you assume that we share such a relationship?"</strong><br/> He demanded,<br/> <strong>"You've seen how awfully we get along-"</strong></p><p align="center"><strong><em>"Hence why I used the term tryst."</em></strong><br/> Snoke said,<br/> <em><strong>"it was absolutely and utterly beyond grotesque. I used the force to posses some insight regarding Kylo Ren and his training, but</strong></em><br/><em><strong> No.</strong></em><br/><em><strong> Instead, I felt it. I felt it as you did Ren, and it made me want to vomit.</strong></em><br/><em><strong> I heard every bit. How you moaned, pleaded the General's name, osculating madly like a bunch of savages... And don't even try to deny it; I see that scab almost completely healed on your lip, Kylo."</strong></em></p><p align="center">The silence was like<br/> Death trying to kill both of them.</p><p align="center">Hux couldn't talk<br/> And</p><p align="center">Kylo's face was vibrant in red mortification,<br/> Touching his bottom lip.<br/> Hux's was completely healed now,<br/> And his own was healed enough that<br/> Pain didn't ghost anymore.<br/> Nonetheless,<br/> He wanted to die.</p><p align="center">All those conversations...<br/> Every sense of pleasure or worry he felt...<br/> Every time he was touched...<br/> Every time he had an orgasm...</p><p align="center">Snoke felt and heard it all.<br/> It was shared all along and<br/> That's when Kylo realized that even<br/> His soul<br/> Wasn't free.</p><p align="center">Magma was now boiling in his<br/> Volcano stomach.<br/> It was as if all the vehemence<br/> Like Black,<br/> Was in his heart,<br/> And<br/> It was as cold as Hux's eyes,</p><p align="center">Kylo tightened his fists.<br/> Magma showed from within his cheeks.<br/> Holy Hell was gonna show.<br/> He was gonna do it-<br/> Blow the fuse and end it all in a massacre.<br/> Snoke was gonna get it<br/> Snoke was gonna get it<br/> Snoke was gonna get it<br/> Snoke was gonna-</p><p align="center"><em>"You...Y-you can't do that!"</em> He shrieked,<br/> Far more feeble than he felt,<br/> Like a mouse to a giant.<br/> Tears streamed down his cheeks<br/> And the shriek, like a needle,<br/> Pierced all of their eardrums.</p><p align="center">The noise was nothing more than a<br/> Squeak,<br/> Compared to the<br/> Something more than life that existed<br/> Deep within<br/> Him.<br/> And it made him tired.</p><p align="center"><em><strong>"Indeed I can, Kylo Ren."</strong></em><br/> Snoke said,<br/> <strong><em>"I understand your anger, but I own you: mind and soul. I have every right to look into you as I please. And for the General..."</em></strong></p><p align="center">Hux could clearly see Snoke<br/> Morphing into a demon.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"How dare you feel contrary to what the First Order suffices??? I know what you thought. I felt every doubt, every ill will towards our Order. How you helped that Woman, and I cannot even imagine how you managed to kill your own Lieutenant! Your father was right; You are weaker than any inbred clone within this army. You are pathetic. I will have it seen that you are discharged from serving within our military, but that won't be the end of it. I will curse you for the remainder of your life, Armitage Hux.

  </strong>
</p><p align="center"><em>"Enough!!"</em> Kylo screamed.<br/> He bared his teeth,<br/> Clenched his fists,<br/> And forced all energy into<br/> A single punch that hit<br/> The Supreme Leader's<br/> Abdomen.</p><p align="center">When he hit him,<br/> It was as if a sonic boom was released,<br/> And the Supreme Leader almost collapsed.</p><p align="center">Kylo was breathing heavy,<br/> Sweating,<br/> And massaging his right fist.<br/> Hux only stood<br/> Just like the pathetic statue he is.<br/> His mouth hung.</p><p align="center">After Snoke left out a belch,<br/> Kylo gasped,<br/> And tried to run to his Hux.<br/> But as he ran,<br/> Snoke already had his arm out,<br/> Yelled,<strong><em> "TRAITOR."</em></strong><br/> And Kylo was thrown across the room.</p><p align="center">He slammed into a wall,<br/> Then rolled on the floor below until he<br/> Stopped.<br/> Like a fly who had been stepped on,<br/> Kylo whined and wheezed,<br/> Pawing at his ribs in the fetal position<br/> He was in.</p><p align="center">Hux let out a cry of grief and<br/> Ran to him.<br/> He tried to touch him,<br/> But Kylo's muscles only became frenetic,<br/> And cried out.</p><p align="center">It made Hux jump back<br/> As if Kylo was made of glass.<br/> So he hovered his hands over<br/> His curves<br/> Instead, and<br/> Mewled.<br/> <strong>"Kylo! Please tell me you're going to be okay..."</strong></p><p align="center">Despite the pain he was in,<br/> Kylo tried to roll over on his stomach.<br/> <em>"I'm fine. I'm fucking fine.

    <p align="center">There can only be one God.</p><p align="center">No voiced, Hux tore himself from Kylo<br/> And marched to his Superior<br/> In a way that could only be interpreted as:<br/> <em>"False gallantry."</em></p><p align="center"><em><strong>"It's a shame Kylo Ren has to go this way..."</strong></em><br/> Said the Supreme Leader, lowly,</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"...Don't you agree General?"</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">Hux snapped up from twiddling with his fingers<br/> (Just as pathetically as last time!)<br/> And saw it in his eyes.<br/> Oh, Snoke was mocking him.</p><p align="center"><strong>"I'm sorry."</strong> Was his reply.</p><p align="center">He raised his browbones again,<br/> And leaned closer into Hux<br/> As if he hadn't heard him the first time.</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"Why must you be sorry, Armitage Hux?"</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">Hux's eyes stayed fixated on his hands,<br/> For if he dared even look up upon Snoke,<br/> The tears plucking at his eyelashes<br/> May have actually fell out of his eyes.</p><p align="center"><strong>"I committed a sin,"</strong> he said,<br/> And hoped.<br/> How he hoped<br/> That Kylo was listening.<br/> Because Hux could feel it:<br/> His eyes still glistened as if he were alive.<br/> (And maybe he was wrong<br/> Maybe he was right<br/> But<br/> The afterlife had to exist in one way or<br/> Another and<br/> Hux liked to think that Kylo was there<br/> Standing next to him<br/> Like he was a couple minutes ago.<br/> He had to be.)</p><p align="center"><strong>"It is the most corrupt yet beautiful sins of all time."</strong> He began,<br/> Like Snoke was his priest,</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"That sin was love, and I loved Kylo Ren more than love itself. I cannot bear being without him, for he is the missing puzzle piece upon my godforsaken life. So, Supreme Leader, with all due urgency, if you plan to kill me, please do it now."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Partially aghast and<br/> Partially vexed by such a remark,<br/> The Supreme Leader frowned upon him.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"If death is what you want, then I assure you, Armitage Hux, that I will do everything in my power to ensure that you stay alive.

  </strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong>"Actually,"</strong> Hux said,<br/> Voice weak from the thought of even returning<br/> To Papa,<br/> <strong>"If you're speaking in those such terms, then it is your Knight who defiled me. You don't understand that sin of love, Supreme Leader. Kylo Ren loved his father with his entire soul, and he changed on that day he committed his patricide; I'm glad he did, for he wouldn't have changed me if he didn't. He made me discover the humanity in my heart that I thought I had lost, and I shall be forever grateful for that."</strong></p><p align="center">The chagrin in which Snoke felt<br/> Caressed him into complete and utter<br/> Disarray.<br/> His best apprentice-<br/> Committed the defilement!<br/> Such a poor appointment Snoke had made!<br/> Perhaps it was justified now that she,<br/> Natural Selection,<br/> Is taking another victim!</p><p align="center">The thoughts even drove him to snarl like<br/> A dog<br/> At dear Armitage Hux!</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"I don't believe any of that trash which spews out of your mouth, ex-General."</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">Despite cringing at the 'ex-General' comment,<br/> Hux was nonetheless calmer than his<br/> Superior:</p><p align="center"><strong>"To be fair,"</strong> he said, <strong>"I would have been surprised if you did."</strong></p><p align="center">Hux was definitely provoking him,<br/> And Snoke took the bait.<br/> He dusted himself off,<br/> And sighed.<br/> He still walked just as gaudy as before<br/> Even when he beckoned Hux:</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"Well, ex-General, are you ready to go home?"</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">Hux bowed his head, reluctantly.<br/> <strong>"Yes."</strong><br/> <strong>(No.)</strong></p><p align="center">Looking back up,<br/> Hux smirked, for he saw that<br/> Sheer disquietude painted on<br/> Snoke's face.</p><p align="center">He knew.</p><p align="center">Spider squawked in his pocket<br/> As Hux blaster out from beneath his coat,<br/> Aiming for the Supreme Leader's head,<br/> Forcing Snoke to see the stars that he killed.</p><p align="center">When he pulled the trigger,<br/> He and Spider both hoped the bullet<br/> Would actually hit him,<br/> But they knew Snoke wouldn't go that easy.</p><p align="center">Ignorant.<br/> Armitage Hux was ignorant for making that<br/> Move.<br/> He should have thought before he acted,<br/> Rather than playing hero to save the Galaxy.<br/> Now, he is alive,<br/> But he was already dead;<br/> Snoke had caught the bullet<br/> And changed its direction.</p><p align="center">It was heading right for him.</p><p align="center">Certainly, Hux did not fear his own death.<br/> He was in fact looking forward to it<br/> Now that Kylo was already there.<br/> (Did it feel good?<br/> Does it feel calm?<br/> Is it better than life?)<br/> But he wanted nothing more than to see<br/> Snoke burn before he did accept fate.</p><p align="center">Yes, that was the Grand Plan:<br/> He would assassinate Supreme Leader Snoke,<br/> Then commit his own suicide to reunite<br/> With his Kylo.</p><p align="center">Hux didn't even flinch as his life passed<br/> Before him,<br/> But he never felt pain.</p><p align="center">Clink.</p><p align="center">The Galaxy stopped.<br/> Hux looked down.</p><p align="center">The bullet had fallen off his shoe,<br/> And rolled over to the heels of his feet.<br/> Spider chirped and wiggled within his pocket.<br/> (Was it actually protecting him?)</p><p align="center">Nonetheless, it made him smirk<br/> Now that the realization of him being invincible<br/> Came to him.</p><p align="center">Snoke was just as shocked,<br/> Then he turned to Kylo's dead body stuck<br/> In the wall,<br/> And growled.</p><p align="center">He swung at Hux,<br/> But he dodged his fist.</p><p align="center">At the second swing, Snoke could blatantly<br/> Punch him,<br/> And when he did,<br/> He couldn't even harm Hux<br/> Because it seemed that his hand was<br/> Instead met with a barrier.</p><p align="center">Snoke's knuckles cracked immediately<br/> Upon impact,<br/> And he hissed inhumanely,<br/> Gripping at his shaking-red-right hand,<br/> Which was crooked and ugly now.<br/> (Just like him.)</p><p align="center">Hux smirked under his Superior's discretion,<br/> But it was short lived as Snoke<br/> Lifted his better, left hand up,<br/> Levitating Hux within the air.</p><p align="center">...Maybe he wasn't so invincible.</p><p align="center">Hux's body was yanked without warning<br/> Into the wall where Kylo had collapsed in.<br/> Spider did try to help him liberally<br/> By making the impact as soft as pillows,<br/> But the shock still knocked the wind out of him.</p><p align="center">Shaken and weak,<br/> Hux crawled along the floor with<br/> The intention to get up on his feet,<br/> Though he was pitifully met with<br/> Kylo's maggot-food body.</p><p align="center">He gasped, and rolled to his other side,<br/> Back facing the corpse.</p><p align="center">Unfortunately,<br/> It still hadn't quite clicked inside his<br/> (Pathetic little) mind that<br/> Kylo was in fact dead.</p><p align="center">Kylo's smile: Alive.<br/> Kylo's candle wax tears: Bittersweet.<br/> Kylo's eyes: Stars cried.<br/> Kylo's love: Plush.</p><p align="center">But Kylo's love: Impeccable.</p><p align="center">Such supernatural gorgeousness<br/> Cursed to never resurrect again.</p><p align="center">Hux started to grip his chest<br/> Right where his heart was.</p><p align="center">Images of Kylo flew left and right in his mind<br/> Like bees avoiding raindrops.<br/> The good, like Kylo's happiness,<br/> The bad, like Kylo's sorrow,<br/> The dirty, like Kylo's pleasure,<br/> Everything.</p><p align="center">It was nonexistent now.</p><p align="center">Hux started to cry.<br/> No, not like the cry from last night in the<br/> Overseer's room.<br/> This was completely unlike it.<br/> It was a bawl,<br/> A wail,<br/> A horrid realization for how precious<br/> Life was.</p><p align="center">Hux bawled and bawled over his Kylo.<br/> (Nonexistent)<br/> He was a banshee,<br/> Rubbing his hands all over his crimson face<br/> Until his inner cheeks went raw<br/> And<br/> All while rocking himself back and forth;<br/> Hux was surely dying with him.</p><p align="center">Snoke approached him as he cried,<br/> Unimpressed and appalled,<br/> And short lived protection gave out<br/> As he kicked him,<br/> Beat him like a child,<br/> And caused his nose to bleed.</p><p align="center"><em><strong>"However in the Universe did we let a faggot General slide beneath our noses?"</strong></em><br/> He asked.</p><p align="center">Hux did not reply.<br/> Humiliated,<br/> He only allowed Snoke to keep beating him<br/> As he writhed,<br/> Treating him like Papa,<br/> And letting another tear suicide itself onto the<br/> Floor.</p><p align="center"><strong><em>"You even turned my apprentice into a faggot too!"</em></strong> He gasped.</p><p align="center">Again, Hux made no noise.</p><p align="center">He was a fly by then,<br/> Allowing the Supreme Leader to do<br/> As he wished.</p><p align="center"><strong><em>"Why won't you answer me?!?"</em></strong><br/> He demanded.<br/> Hux only whined more,</p><p align="center">So Snoke kicked his groin,<br/> And his hands immediately went between<br/> His legs as he groaned.</p><p align="center">Belittling him must have been amazing.<br/> <strong><em>"You are not apart of the superior species."</em></strong></p><p align="center">There was another kick to his groin,<br/> Despite the hands.<br/> Hux wanted to plead mercy,<br/> But he wasn't going to give Snoke that<br/> Satisfaction.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"You seized Kylo Ren's virginity; made him impure-"</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">The superior being<br/> proceeded to press the ball of his<br/> Boot<br/> Against Hux's cheek; right between the<br/> Jawbone and temple.<br/> From there on, the pressure crescendoed.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"Now look at what I had to do. You infected him, made him a faggot. I could have changed him back, gave him back his virginity, convinced him you were no good..."</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">Hux held his mouth open.<br/> He was gasping, hyperventilating,<br/> Begging for the oxygen which would not<br/> Grant him relief.<br/> He was writhing, his body squirming<br/> Like a fish without water,<br/> Grabbing for the boots,<br/> Grabbing for his face,<br/> Or grabbing for the floor.</p><p align="center">Supreme Leader only pressed deeper,<br/> And<br/> Hux knew his jaw was going to crack.<br/> (My God it was right by him.<br/> He just realized.)<br/> Bone was bending;<br/> (Dear God he's just crying or screaming<br/> Without the noise... Oh he didn't know.)<br/> Nerves were devastated;<br/> Screaming;<br/> (It's right nest to him)<br/> Spider was weeping,<br/> And Snoke was going to utter something,<br/> Something so vile,<br/> So sinful,<br/> He just had to utter it to Hux's ear,<br/> For if he said it loud enough,<br/> He may have become defiled too:</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>"How did it feel to engage in coital acts with my apprentice?"</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">Yes<br/> Yes<br/> Yes<br/> He's just close enough.<br/> (Hux is touching it.)<br/> Horror failed to reflect from his eyes.<br/> (He has it.)</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>"I'm going to make you pay for what you did;</strong>
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
    <strong> I'm going to have you abused and raped until you forget your own name. I'll make sure you are raped by women, and then after you're perfect, I'll put you in faggot therapy. I'll make sure-"</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>CLASH.</em>
</p><p align="center">Supreme leader's head dropped from<br/> His neck.<br/> The body twitches violently<br/> As if being electrocuted, and<br/> Blood splattered from exposed,<br/> Pulsing arteries,<br/> Straight onto Hux's body and face.</p><p align="center">Hux stared at Kylo's lightsaber in his hand,<br/> How it buzzed maliciously,<br/> (It did its job)<br/> And then at Snoke's decapitated head.<br/> It was dead,<br/> staring,<br/> Grinning,<br/> At Hux.</p><p align="center">He proceeded to scream back at it,<br/> Soon to throw it off his chest.</p><p align="center">As the head bounced on the floor<br/> With a disturbing thud,<br/> Hux rubbed himself clean on his Superior's<br/> Blood<br/> To the point of purity.</p><p align="center">Soon, he followed that by crawling to his<br/> Deceased lover.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Kylo,"</strong> Hux begged.<br/> He cradled himself within the confines of<br/> Kylo's vomit encrusted chest.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Oh Kylo, please...."</strong>
</p><p align="center">The wretched smell of him didn't matter,<br/> Neither did the vile kiss Hux gave him.<br/> (And oh it tasted like acid and bile like<br/> Rotten flies making love atop of sour fruits.)</p><p align="center"><strong>"You have to be alive..."</strong> he said,<br/> Tugging at his clothes,<br/> <strong>"You've wanted to see this for so long! It was your destiny to see this! Can you not hear me?"</strong></p><p align="center">No response.<br/> Kylo's eyes remained shut.<br/> If they wouldn't open soon,<br/> Hux would have to be loyal to his<br/> Grand Plan.</p><p align="center"><strong>"I..."</strong> he began,<br/> <strong>"I'm going to take this..."</strong><br/> he brought his lover's lightsaber up to his neck. </p><p align="center">
  <strong>"...I'm going to kill myself with it, Kylo. I'm going to slit my throat or decapitate my head like I did to Snoke; I don't care if there's life after death or not... all I know is that my life is cursed without you."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Still leaning up against his body,<br/> Staring up upon him like he was his deity,<br/> Hux was careful not to taint Kylo's skin<br/> Or crow black hair<br/> As he brought the heat closer to his neck.<br/> He was extremely uncomfortable by then.</p><p align="center"><strong>"I'm going to do it."</strong> He told Kylo.<br/> (As if he could listen...)</p><p align="center">The skin on Hux's neck started burning.<br/> The pain had him crying again,<br/> And sometimes the tears would land on the<br/> Lightsaber,<br/> Imploding within a short lived sizzle.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Kylo, please wake up..."</strong><br/> Heat tore deeper into his neck,<br/> <strong>"I swear to God, Benjamin Solo!"</strong></p><p align="center">Kylo proceeded to do nothing.<br/> Hux could feel his own blood spread across<br/> His neck,<br/> Dripping,<br/> Pouring,<br/> And he was hissing,<br/> Gritting his teeth.</p><p align="center">Spider started screeching,<br/> And Hux snarled out a cough<br/> And threw the lightsaber all the way<br/> To the other side of that room.</p><p align="center">He breathed heavy,<br/> And took Spider out of his pocket,<br/> For the screeching was too much to bear.</p><p align="center">He wiped the blood from his neck,<br/> Though it continued to pour,<br/> And encapsulated Spider within<br/> His heart.</p><p align="center">It was mourning Kylo too.</p><p align="center"><strong>"It's pathetic that I can't even get myself to kill me,"</strong> Hux told it.</p><p align="center">Spider wanted to spit in his face for the remark.</p><p align="center">Accepting his defeat,<br/> Hux slithered backwards from the hole<br/> Onto the floor.<br/> Curled around Spider and weeped.<br/> Out of any time he wanted Death, it was now.<br/> In fact, he didn't even want it: He needed it.<br/> He yearned to be enveloped by its black<br/> And<br/> Become indistinguishable from the darkness<br/> Where he belonged,</p><p align="center">For he was a martyr now,<br/> And he knew.<br/> He hadn't died yet but he knew he would.</p><p align="center">Spider tried, with all of its might to coddle him,<br/> But it couldn't do anything.<br/> Hux did feel something brush against his<br/> Shoulder,<br/> And maybe it was his mother;<br/> Maybe she was dead;<br/> Maybe she was coddling him for<br/> He was indeed dying.<br/> (Oh, he hoped it was true.)</p><p align="center">But whatever feeling of sorrow Hux felt before,<br/> The feeling soon turned violent within him<br/> As Spider begged for him to look up<br/> At Kylo.</p><p align="center">Hux gasped.<br/> Kylo was convulsing within that hole<br/> In the wall!</p><p align="center">Hux ran to him and pulled him out, and<br/> Laid him on the floor and sat on top of him,<br/> Pinning his wrists to it and crucifying him.</p><p align="center">He hoped doing that would stop the seizure,<br/> Or at least help its symptoms,<br/> But nothing worked.<br/> Kylo still convulsed and<br/> His eyes vibrated horrendously beneath<br/> His eyelids.</p><p align="center">And just like a snap of the fingers,<br/> He was dead again.</p><p align="center">There was a pause.<br/> Everything around Hux stopped,<br/> Like his heart,<br/> And became everything at the same time.</p><p align="center">Kylo's eyes started fluttering,<br/> Then opened abruptly.<br/> They looked as sad as they'd always been.</p><p align="center">Without warning,<br/> And as confusing as it was for Kylo,<br/> Hux had his face buried him his neck,<br/> Crying.<br/> Loving him despite the chunks of vomit<br/> That would be on him afterwards.<br/> (It made Spider sing.)</p><p align="center">Kylo held back onto him,<br/> As Hux buried his head in his neck<br/> Even more.<br/> His eyelashes were tickling him,<br/> And Kylo could feel the wetness of his eyes.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Please don't leave me again like that,"</strong><br/> Hux said,<br/> <strong>"I don't ever want you to die."</strong></p><p align="center"><em>"I was never dead Hux."</em> Kylo said.</p><p align="center">Hux got up,<br/> <strong>"Then why didn't you answer me? Look at my neck! I was going to kill myself!"</strong></p><p align="center">The confusion on Kylo's face struck into<br/> Horror,<br/> As a shaken hand hovered over his<br/> Bleeding neck.</p><p align="center"><em>"I..."</em> Kylo's voice trembled,<br/> <em>"I would never want you to..."</em></p><p align="center"><strong>"I'm okay,"</strong> Hux said, <strong>"I couldn't even get myself to do it. Please tell me what was happening to you?"</strong></p><p align="center">Kylo cupped Hux's cheek,<br/> Where Hux held it firm and in place.<br/> Kylo's eyes softened,<br/> And his lips opened,</p><p align="center">
  <em>"I was dead, but I wasn't. At first I was in deep meditation, in astral projection; I was blocking Snoke from hurting you. Then, I actually did die, or I didn't die: I was in Limbo, because I was fighting to be alive again. But then, something else happened..."</em>
</p><p align="center"><strong>"What was it?"</strong> Hux asked.</p><p align="center"><em>"I saw this light..."</em> Kylo said, <em>"and thinking it was my way to wake up, I ran as fast as I could for it, and when I arrived at it, I...</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>I...</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I..."</em>
</p><p align="center"><strong>"You what?"</strong> Hux asked.</p><p align="center">Happy tears were forming out the sides of<br/> Kylo's eyes, and<br/> He smiled,</p><p align="center">
  <em>"I met my father."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux raised his eyebrows in shock,<br/> And asked him,<br/> "So you were officially dead?"</p><p align="center"><em>"I guess I was, at one point."</em> Kylo replied,<br/> <em>"But when I saw him, my brain told me to run. I wanted to, I wanted to so bad, but my body refused to. I wasn't crying or screaming at him either, I just stared at him, like it was all I could do. He wasn't old either; he had brown hair again... and he looked my age, perhaps younger,</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>But he asked me</em>
  <br/>
  <em> 'Why are you here?'</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I told him that Snoke had killed me.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Then there was a silence, a very, very deafening silence... until I wiped a tear off my cheek. I noticed my scar was gone.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He knew I realized this,</em>
  <br/>
  <em> And told me I looked way better without it.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I asked him why he didn't hate me.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He said it was because he loved me,</em>
  <br/>
  <em> So I told him he was full of shit."</em>
</p><p align="center">And Kylo started to laugh,</p><p align="center">
  <em>"But I told him I was sorry for what I did, for being a horrible son, for causing him and mother so much grief...</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He said I wasn't horrible, and that he and my mother wanted me back by their side.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I didn't reply, I only repeated myself,</em>
  <br/>
  <em> This time only asking for him to forgive me killing him.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>And he said he did.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>My face was wet in my own tears by then,</em>
  <br/>
  <em> And I physically felt him hug me. He even told me how great of a person you were, Hux, and that he was thankful I had a person like you in my life...</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I told him how much I loved you, and if I would ever be alive again.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He said I would, but I would have to leave him to do so. I started to panic, Hux, it was the first time I had seen him as my Father in the longest time. I told him how I'd didn't want to leave him,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>But I also told him how much I didn't want to leave you...</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He told me I was too young to die, but he wouldn't care if I stayed.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I told him I couldn't, and that I wanted to go home... to Mother.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He said she would love that.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Then he proceeded to tell me the name of the planet that the Resistance Headquarters were located on: D'Qar.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I thanked him, and told him I loved him. The blackness around us was making him disappear, and it scared me. I wanted to go too, so bad, but I knew it wasn't my place.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He told me he loved me too, and that he couldn't wait to see me again, hopeful that you would be there too.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>And then I woke up."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux stared blankly at him.<br/> (He still had to take it all in...)</p><p align="center">
  <em>"There's life after death, Hux, and my father has forgiven me! Can you believe it? I'm so happy!"</em>
</p><p align="center">Kylo proceeded to drag Hux down with him,<br/> And hug him mercilessly.<br/> But his face changed as his jaw dropped.</p><p align="center">He saw Snoke's decapitated head behind<br/> Them.</p><p align="center"><em>"You killed him..."</em> Kylo said,<br/><em> "Hux you literally killed him..."</em></p><p align="center">Hux turned back to what Kylo was staring at,<br/> And looked back at him, smiling,</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"I did."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Now, Kylo's tears were even happier.<br/> They were free.</p>

<p align="center">He felt it.<br/> He knew that she knew.</p>
<p align="center">So he walked faster.<br/> Muscles were tearing and<br/> His lungs were screaming<br/> But motivation begged him to continue on.</p>
<p align="center">He found her marching down a secluded<br/> Hallway.<br/> The one just off the site of their Superior's<br/> Death.<br/> Oh, she should have been there when he died.</p>
<p align="center">Ben walked faster.<br/> She really should have been there.<br/> Screaming.<br/> She really-</p>
<p align="center">"Tell me this is a dream."<br/> She stopped;<br/> Took off her helmet and threw it to the side<br/> Of the wall<br/> Like scrap metal.</p>
<p align="center">Ben smiled, and shook his head.<br/><em> "It's not. We're free Phasma. We're finally free, and that is the dream."</em></p>
<p align="center">She stared at him,<br/> A form of sorrow he had never seen<br/> Bloomed from her eyes.<br/> He could see it concocted with fear.<br/> "Did you kill him like that? Like a savage looking for revenge?"</p>
<p align="center">Ben shook his head again.<br/> <em>"Hux did it; I was gone."</em></p>
<p align="center">Her lip quivered.<br/> (Gone?)<br/> "How...<br/> How did he do it?"</p>
<p align="center"><em>"I shielded him,"</em> Ben said, <em>"and Spider helped him."</em><br/> Kylo pulled the spider she had given him<br/> From his pocket,<br/> And presented it to her.<br/> <em>"You really helped us."</em></p>
<p align="center">Now,<br/> She was appalled.<br/> "Get that dreadful thing out of my sight!"</p>
<p align="center">Spider smacked it from Ben,<br/> Where it skidded across the floor.<br/> It wheezed, and became dizzy,<br/> But it did not break.</p>
<p align="center">Ben hissed,<br/> And flooded to it like a creature,<br/> Holding it up to his chest.<br/> Feeling.</p>
<p align="center">"I would have never given you that pathetic spider had I known it would make you<br/> This delusional,"<br/>She said,<br/> "I can't believe you bought into that superstition that the lady I told you about had with it. I gave it to you to because I didn't want it, it was trash. I never would've guessed you would go this far."</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>"I'm not, Phasma. The General and I, my Lover, we ended Supreme Leader's corruption. We're all free, can't you see that?!? And since we're free to do what we please, I wanted to invite you to escape with us."</em>
</p>
<p align="center">"Escape with you and General Hux?!?"<br/> She scoffed,<br/> "when everything I had, everything I am lies within the confines of this Order? To be free for me means to come back to the dirt from which I came. To be free means that I went from Captain to a woman of nothing. You and your General may be fine with that, but I am certainly not. I was wrong when I said you thought like a woman; every pigly man acts the same, with no concern for the future whatsoever."</p>
<p align="center">Tears were sliding down the edges of her cheeks,<br/> "Now, Kylo Ren, I want you, your General, and your godforsaken Spider to leave me, for this will be the last time we will ever talk, do you hear me?"</p>
<p align="center">Ben tried to get closer to her to comfort<br/> Her,<br/> But she pulled out a blade and<br/> Shrieked,<br/> "DO YOU HEAR ME?"</p>
<p align="center">He put his arms down,<br/> Watched the blade,<br/> And stepped away from her.<br/> He stopped half way,<br/> Gesturing her last chance to leave,<br/> But all she said was:</p>
<p align="center">"You have an hour to rid yourself of this ship till I tell my men. I will have no mercy after the sixtieth minute."</p>
<p align="center">Ben nodded,<br/> And left.</p>

    <p align="center">Ben came out running,<br/> Scaring Hux into actually cutting the<br/> Tie fighter off the wall.</p><p align="center">Stormtroopers noticed the commotion,<br/> But they still did not ask.<br/> (The apprehension of death loomed over them<br/> Like a ghost,<br/> For if they did ask,<br/> They thought bodies would fall.)</p><p align="center">Ben yelled for him to get inside,<br/> So Hux did,<br/> And Millicent fell asleep on his lap as<br/> He settled.</p><p align="center">She had awoken, however,<br/> When Ben brushed against her<br/> As Hux pulled him into the ship.</p><p align="center">Ben sat in the cockpit, with Hux<br/> Already preparing switches for take off.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Where's Phasma?"</strong> He asked.</p><p align="center">Ben shut his eyes,<br/> Petted Spider.<br/> <em>"She's not coming."</em></p><p align="center">Hux nodded, and started the ship.<br/> But as he shut the door,<br/> A brave solider inquired why he<br/> And the apprentice were inside.</p><p align="center">Hux simply answered by saying<br/> <strong>"There was an emergency errand to make."</strong><br/> (Genius.)</p><p align="center">Before the Stormtrooper could even<br/> Ask where they were going,<br/> Hux shut the door, and flew off.</p><p align="center">Cannons alongside the ship focused on them,<br/> But they never shot.<br/> Someone knew who they were<br/> And what they were doing,<br/> Whether that be Phasma or<br/> The lone Stormtrooper,<br/> Hux was still immensely thankful.</p><p align="center"><em>"Hey, Armitage?"</em><br/> Ben asked.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"What is it?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Do you think... Phasma wanted to come?"</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"I don't even know the conversation you had with her."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Ben settled deeper into the thin cushion<br/> Lining that cockpit.<br/> (Only a mouse could fit in it!)<br/> Sat spider next to him,<br/> And huffed.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"She said she would ascend to the dirt had she had the freedom that we did. She ridiculed me, called me delusional, but she was crying. She gave us the extra hour to leave before telling anyone, though... and if she were really that loyal, she would have killed me."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux thought about what Ben had said,<br/> Then said to him:</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"The Captain was our friend; a dear friend at that. It had always been me, you, and her, together, against the Galaxy. She was the only other person on the ship- besides me- that knew what your face looked like."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Ben focused down on his fingers,<br/> Twiddling with them,<br/> Despite barely being able to see them<br/> Through the red tint of the lights inside.<br/> Hux sighed in melancholy.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"She did what she did out of love. She cares about us, so much. We were her only best friends after all. Personally... I think she fears the Order."</strong>
</p><p align="center"><em>"I agree."</em> Ben said,<br/> <em>"Do you think she'll ever liberate herself?"</em></p><p align="center"><strong>"Doubt it."</strong><br/> Hux said,<br/> Hands still tight on the steering wheel.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Are you sure you want to go to D'Qar?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Why do you ask?"</em>
</p><p align="center">Millicent had hopped herself off<br/> Hux's lap, and scurried over to Ben.<br/> Purring on him and<br/> Begging his affection.<br/> Ben did pet her.</p><p align="center"><strong>"I was only making sure this was your final decision."</strong> He said,<br/> <strong>"Because you know I have no place to go, no place to be..."</strong></p><p align="center"><em>"I don't have anywhere either,"</em> Ben replied,<br/> <em>"Just the planet where my mother is."</em></p><p align="center">Hux was visibly shaken now,<br/> Tapping his foot on the floor for<br/> Something<br/> Something<br/> Something<br/> Some sort of noise.</p><p align="center"><em>"What's wrong?"</em> Ben asked.</p><p align="center">Hux covered his mouth,<br/> But his foot only became more violent.</p><p align="center">The clat-clat-clatter<br/> Of his teeth could be heard.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Nothing."</strong>
</p><p align="center"><em>"Nothing is still something."</em> Ben said,<br/> <em>"Tell me what's wrong."</em></p><p align="center">Hux said nothing.<br/> Ben stood up,<br/> Stumbling within the friction controlling the<br/> Starfighter,<br/> But he stumbled his way to Hux,<br/> Which was all he needed.</p><p align="center">He was shaking madly,<br/> And Ben brushed his head against<br/> His shoulder,<br/> Repeated himself:<br/> <em>"What's wrong?"</em></p><p align="center"><strong>"I'm scared."</strong> He said.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"Why must you be scared?"</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"You and I know I will be executed on sight right upon being spotted by any Resistance ally. I am a monster to them."</strong>
</p><p align="center"><em>"You won't." </em>Ben said,<br/><em> "You are a lesser evil to them than anyone else within the order."</em></p><p align="center">He started to rub up and down Hux's arm,<br/> <em>"Should you be held at gunpoint, I'll hold onto you. I know my mother has told them not to kill me, so if I cover you, they won't shoot."</em></p><p align="center">Hux looked at him, still filled with doubt,<br/> But nodded.</p><p align="center"><em>"So,"</em><br/> Ben asked,<br/> <em>"How long is it going to take to get there?"</em></p><p align="center">Hux thought...<br/> <strong>"Forever."</strong></p><p align="center">But Ben smiled,<br/> <em>"I believe forever has an end."</em><br/> He was done talking to Hux<br/> As something entirely different caught<br/> His attention.<br/> He descended back to the cockpit</p><p align="center">And from the corner of his eye,<br/> He thought he saw Father.</p><p align="center">Maybe,<br/> Just maybe he had spoken too soon now.<br/> For he soon became lethargic and<br/> Turned to him completely,<br/> Bit his lip in case he were real and<br/> Felt visions dance limpid on his irises.</p><p align="center"><em>"Damned."</em> Escaped quietly from his lips<br/> As father finally approached him.<br/> Ben was lost in the background to him,<br/> Until he touched him.</p><p align="center">Ben looked at him.<br/> He was smiling.<br/> No words were said, but<br/> Ben felt his arms around him<br/> In their hug.<br/> He knew this would be the last time he'd see<br/> Him,<br/> And as he fell for cockpit cushions,<br/> Father went out like a candle flame.</p>

    <p align="center">Ben opened his eyes to war.<br/>
Except<br/>
That so called war had been the engine<br/>
Of an X-Wing fighter.</p><p align="center">It made his ears bleed as it passed over him<br/>
Above the canopy he lied beneath.<br/>
When it's Doppler died,<br/>
He could finally calm.</p><p align="center">He laid his head back to the lush grass<br/>
Which pillowed his face,<br/>
And hanging over his head was a fern leaf.<br/>
Rich and green,<br/>
He saw a spider mother<br/>
Hidden within the end of the leaf,<br/>
Cuddling her eggs at the stem and<br/>
Protecting them<br/>
From Ben.</p><p align="center">Millicent was curled against his thigh,<br/>
And Hux staring at the sky<br/>
Three meters away from him.</p><p align="center">Ben stood,<br/>
And wobbled over to him.</p><p align="center"><em>"Where's the tie fighter?"</em> He asked.</p><p align="center">Hux, almost shocked by his voice,<br/>
Turned to him,<br/>
Said:<br/>
<strong>"The landing wasn't easy; I crashed into a lake. I had to carry you here, for should a Resistance pilot notice the wreckage, we won't be anywhere near it."</strong></p><p align="center">Ben knotted his eyebrows.<br/>
<em>"You had to carry me?"</em></p><p align="center">
  <strong>"You passed out. How you did, I don't know."</strong>
</p><p align="center">Ben rubbed his head,<br/>
Tried to remember,<br/>
But he couldn't.<br/>
All he had was<br/>
The vision of an outline<br/>
Touching him.<br/>
Who it was, he didn't know.</p><p align="center"><em>"I don't know either."</em> He said,<br/>
Looking down at the ground.<br/>
But he came back up,<br/>
<em>"I assume we made it to D'Qar?"</em></p><p align="center">Hux nodded.<br/>
<strong>"I don't know how we're going to find the Resistance Base. We're in the middle of nowhere."</strong></p><p align="center"><em>"Well,"</em> Ben said,<br/>
Looked up to the sky.<br/>
The X-Wing was a dot in it now.<br/>
Still, he pointed to it.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"The X-Wing, it was really close to the canopy. That means it must be landing. I think we should follow it. I don't feel like the base is far."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux picked up Millicent<br/>
Who had tip toed her way to him,<br/>
and looked at Ben,<br/>
<strong>"I think we should do it."</strong></p><p align="center">With that,<br/>
The two stood,<br/>
Ben still struggling slighting.<br/>
(The limp certainly did not help in this<br/>
Situation!)</p><p align="center"><em>"Hux."</em> He said.</p><p align="center">Hux turned to him.<br/>
<strong>"What?"</strong></p><p align="center">
  <em>"You need to take your coat off."</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>"Why?"</strong>
</p><p align="center">Ben pointed to the First Order emblem at<br/>
His shoulder.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"The Resistance sees that, and you're dead.</em><br/>
<em> Take it off."</em>
</p><p align="center">Hux sighed,<br/>
And parted with his beloved coat.<br/>
Laid it to rot on the ground<br/>
With the plush grass<br/>
And<br/>
The spider family.</p><p align="center">Ben even took off his hood<br/>
As a commerce.</p><p align="center"><em>"Oh, and...</em>" he added,<br/>
Ripped Spider from his pocket<br/>
And<br/>
Returned him to Hux.</p><p align="center"><em>"It belongs to you now."</em> Ben said.</p><p align="center">Hux took Spider and<br/>
Put it in his chest pocket.<br/>
It nearly grinned at him as he did so.</p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">The blood boiled magma with Ben's veins.<br/>
He could feel his mother<br/>
The more he and Hux followed the X-Wing<br/>
Which has become nothing but an<br/>
Apparition<br/>
In the sky.</p><p align="center">The sun was growing tired,<br/>
Yet the sky refused to become pink.</p><p align="center">Ben and Hux<br/>
Tore through vine and<br/>
Walked across meadows.<br/>
When they entered a clearing,<br/>
That's when Ben saw<br/>
Another resistance ship had ascending to<br/>
The sky.</p><p align="center"><em>"Look."</em> He said,<br/>
<em>"That's where the base is!"</em> He smiled.<br/>
Nearly hopped and danced around<br/>
Hux.</p><p align="center">Ben almost combusted and cried onto him<br/>
When he said<br/>
<em>"I feel my mother there!"</em></p><p align="center">Despite the limp,<br/>
He started to run.<br/>
Hux ran after him,<br/>
Nearly tripped and fell over some<br/>
Branches,<br/>
But he caught up to Ben when he<br/>
Too fell down.</p><p align="center">Hux helped him up.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Don't overexert yourself."</strong><br/>
He said.</p><p align="center">Ben was against his chest,<br/>
Breathing heavy<br/>
With lazy eyelids.</p><p align="center">Then he proceeded to tug Hux along with him,<br/>
And hid behind a rock when he heard<br/>
Talking.</p><p align="center"><em>"We're here."</em> Ben said, shaking.</p><p align="center"><strong>"Why are you shaking?"</strong> Hux asked,<br/>
<strong>"Isn't this what you wanted?"</strong></p><p align="center"><em>"Yeah,"</em> Ben said,<br/>
<em>"It's just that</em><br/>
<em> I've waited for this for so long,</em><br/>
<em> And now</em><br/>
<em> I'm scared.</em><br/>
<em> This is so different from what I've been accustomed to,</em><br/>
<em> And I don't even know how to get in."</em></p><p align="center">Hux rubbed his back,<br/>
And kissed his temple.<br/>
<strong>"We're going to figure out something.</strong><br/>
<strong> Don't worry, okay?"</strong></p><p align="center">Ben laughed.<br/>
<em>"You've been worried this whole time, and now you're the one telling me to calm down?"</em></p><p align="center"><strong>"Yeah,"</strong> Hux said,<br/>
<strong>"I realized that you need to get used to change-"</strong></p><p align="center">
  <em>Click.</em>
</p><p align="center">A blaster came to the back of both their heads.</p>

    <p align="center">"Benjamin..."<br/> She said.<br/> Her voice trembled sweetly with her lips.</p>
<p align="center">Ben tried to call for her,<br/> But the rope around his neck<br/> Was being pulled so violently that it<br/> Nearly cut into his throat.</p>
<p align="center">"Untie them!" She commanded,<br/> As raucous as fire,<br/> Scaring Poe Dameron and his cult<br/> Into trembling at her with tails between<br/> Their legs.<br/> If only they really were dogs.</p>
<p align="center">Ben was freed,<br/> And so was Hux.</p>
<p align="center">Leia only studied his face.<br/> "You always looked so much like your father."<br/> She said.</p>
<p align="center">Ben felt the dread pool a graveyard into his<br/> Stomach.<br/> <em>"Mother, Mama..."</em><br/> He cried.</p>
<p align="center">She was smiling,<br/> Wiping the tears from his face.<br/> She shouldn't be smiling though!<br/> How could she?!?<br/> Was she real?!?!?</p>
<p align="center"><em>"Stop smiling."</em> He said.<br/> The grave tone in his voice made her frown.</p>
<p align="center">"What's the matter? You're home. You're okay! Why are you upset?"</p>
<p align="center"><em>"Why are you so clueless?!?"</em> He asked,<br/> Shoving her away from him.<br/> He wanted to-<br/> Desperately-</p>
<p align="center">To escape into her or to Hux.<br/> To feel that sweet pulse of false salvation<br/> And forget he came from his father.</p>
<p align="center">Life wasn't like that.</p>
<p align="center">And so he stared at his mother.<br/> Acute to the horror on his face.</p>
<p align="center">Spider wouldn't save him now.</p>
<p align="center">"Ben." She said,<br/> "if you don't think I know, I know. I know you killed him. You didn't have to do it, but you did, and you can't undo the past. I have forgiven you, Ben. If I didn't, I wouldn't have came to you, yet I did. Why? Because shame on any mother who can't forgive, let alone love, her own child."</p>
<p align="center">More tears bathed across Ben's cheeks.<br/> Some people only stared in shock,<br/> Like Poe Dameron.<br/> Some people nearly fainted at the drama.</p>
<p align="center">Leia only embraced him,<br/> Crying into his chest as Ben held her.</p>
<p align="center"><em>"You shouldn't have forgiven me!"</em> He said,<br/> <em>"I am a cur, Mama! I am a cur to your entire Order! How can you love me and forgive me when I exist as this? Oh, Mama, How??"</em></p>
<p align="center">He sobbed into her neck,<br/> Taking a while to reconcile,<br/> But he calmed, and looked at her.</p>
<p align="center">She wiped his tears again.<br/> "You're no cur Ben. If anyone was, it was that damned Snoke. He turned you into the monster he wanted. He made you kill your father! But he couldn't change you, because look at how guilt-ridden you are now!!! You're all I have, Ben! I would have had nothing if he brainwashed you completely, and I knew he couldn't! Your soul is too pure! So I waited for this day for years! And now it's finally happened! I've had so much time to think about what you did Benjamin! And I forgive you! You don't need to keep pressing!"</p>
<p align="center"><em>"But what about my scar?!?"</em> He demanded,<br/> <em>"This is an eternal remnant of Father's death- Sprawled across my face!!!"</em></p>
<p align="center">And he surveyed the area for her.<br/> He could sense her so strong,<br/> He could taste her vibrant on his tongue.</p>
<p align="center">...And there she was, staring from a distance<br/> In the crowd.</p>
<p align="center">Ben pointed a white, crooked finger at her.</p>
<p align="center"><em>"REY!"</em> He howled.<br/> She whined and hid deeper behind someone.<br/> Hell was burning in his eyes.<br/> To her, in that moment,<br/> Benjamin Solo- or Kylo Ren-<br/> Whoever she saw in that body-<br/> Was Satan.</p>
<p align="center"><em>"You did this to ME."</em> He screamed,<br/> <em>"You have DESTROYED ME. DEFORMED MY FACE. MADE ME UGLY. I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS, REY! WITH THE REMNANTS OF HE AND YOU ON MY BODY! How does that make you feel?? You insufferable little bitch!"</em></p>
<p align="center">He charged for her,<br/> And she screamed.</p>
<p align="center">But Leia-<br/> She caught him.<br/> "-BENJAMIN!"</p>
<p align="center">He stood,<br/> Staring at her.<br/> Breathing heavy and sweating.</p>
<p align="center">"Don't blame her!" She pleaded,<br/> "Turn the meaning of that scar into something different! Oh, Ben! You could have died! What do you think I would do if you and Han Solo died?!? Why, I'd probably kill myself! Think of it as a day you escaped death! Ben, please!"</p>
<p align="center"><em>"I don't care!"</em> Ben said to her,<br/> <em>"I want that whore dead! She defiled me!"</em></p>
<p align="center">"Only if you let yourself think that!"<br/> She held him,<br/> "Don't forget the big picture! Snoke defiled you! Not Rey! You need to take your blame away from her!"</p>
<p align="center">Ben was crying into her again,<br/> And she rocked him.<br/> He was her baby, after all.</p>
<p align="center"><em>"I'm sorry, Mama!"</em> He sobbed,<br/> <em>"I'm just so sorry, and I love you! I love Father! Please..."</em></p>
<p align="center">"I love you too, Ben. And I forgive you. You don't have to keep saying sorry. I gave you your closure, and I know your father would have forgiven you-"</p>
<p align="center"><em>"-He already did."</em> Ben said,<br/> <em>"His ghost haunted me, but he forgave me!"</em></p>
<p align="center">"Then move on!" She said, holding him tight,<br/> "Ben, please just- move on! You heard what you needed from me! You heard what you needed from your father! All you have to think about is the future! The past doesn't exist anymore!"</p>
<p align="center">Ben stared up at the ceiling with puffy eyes,<br/> Breathing violently, and his eyes nearly<br/> Dilated.<br/> He could feel his father-<br/> He couldn't see him, but he knew he felt him!</p>
<p align="center">He was hugging him and his Mother!<br/> He only hid back to her chest.</p>
<p align="center"><em>"Do you feel him too?"</em> He asked.</p>
<p align="center"><em>"I do."</em> She answered.</p>
<p align="center">That completion-<br/> The unification of he, his Mother, and Father.<br/> Coming to terms that Father would never<br/> Leave him.<br/> Not ever feeling like he had to run away<br/> From him<br/> Again.<br/> Oh, he had never felt so happy.</p>
<p align="center">It was was like rising from the grave.<br/> This was Ben and Kylo's salvation.<br/> All they had searched for.</p>
<p align="center">When he and his Mother parted,<br/> He smiled.<br/> And she smiled at him.<br/> For him.</p>
<p align="center">"Ben?" She asked.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>"What?"</em>
</p>
<p align="center">"Of you don't mind my inquiry, who is that man you came with?"</p>
<p align="center">Ben turned around, and saw Hux staring.<br/> The eye of the storm and the post-rainbow.<br/> He nearly melted.</p>
<p align="center"><em>"I am Armitage Hux."</em> He said,<br/> <em>"Ex-General of the First Order..."</em></p>
<p align="center">And he snickered.<br/> As expected, he received gasps from the title.</p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>"...But I am also your son's beloved."</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">Ben came around him and held his hand,<br/> Rested into his shoulder.<br/> He clearly did not care, but<br/> Hux worried about the public affection.</p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>"I can only pray that you will forgive me and my abominations."</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">The ratio of people who could've forgiven him<br/> Was minuscule<br/> Compared to the people who didn't,<br/> Including Poe Dameron.<br/> To the Resistance,<br/> Hux was the true enigma!<br/> He was supposed to be the man who hated them!<br/> He was supposed to wipe them out!<br/> Yet there he was!<br/> Begging for forgiveness!</p>
<p align="center">He was truly the controversial figure now!</p>
<p align="center">Leia Organa,<br/> Like the most powerful god of all,<br/> As she deserved to be-<br/> Peered over Hux.<br/> And she met her conclusion.</p>
<p align="center">"If my Son has entrusted something immaculate into you, then I trust you too. I forgive you, Armitage Hux. Thank you for watching over him when I couldn't."</p>
<p align="center">That wasn't enough for Poe Dameron,<br/> Who ripped from the crowd and<br/> Snarled like a wolf at him.</p>
<p align="center">"Why should the rest of us forgive you?!?"<br/> He demanded.</p>
<p align="center">"Dameron!" She snapped.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>"Let him talk!"</strong> Hux smirked.<br/> But Ben was offended.</p>
<p align="center"><em>"Hux is an artist killer,"</em> he defended,<br/> <em>"He killed Snoke!"</em></p>
<p align="center">Leia and Poe<br/> Along with everyone in that room,<br/> Shot their eyes violently to the ex-General.</p>
<p align="center">"You what?" Leia asked,<br/> "Why didn't you say that at first?!?"</p>
<p align="center"><strong>"Poe didn't give me the chance."</strong> He said.<br/> (Or maybe, he truly did.)</p>
<p align="center">"Did you hear him?!?" Poe called to he crowd.<br/> "He killed Snoke!"</p>
<p align="center">The entire room roared,<br/> With Poe Dameron kissing the ground Hux<br/> Walked upon,<br/> Proving him worthy of their forgiveness.</p>
<p align="center">People came to him,<br/> Hugging and blessing him, gifting him<br/> With whatever valuables they had on them.<br/> To which Hux declined,<br/> But the appreciation nonetheless made<br/> Him merry.<br/> It was a brand on appreciation he had<br/> Only felt with Ben,<br/> Yet here, the Resistance was pouring it on<br/> Him!<br/> It was oozing from the walls!<br/> He wasn't so controversial anymore!</p>
<p align="center">Leia even pulled him and Ben into a tight<br/> Embrace,<br/> (Perhaps even praying he would propose<br/> To her son as she did so)<br/> Promising Hux the highest degree of respect<br/> Within her Resistance.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>"I don't deserve it."</strong> Hux said.</p>
<p align="center">"Oh, but you do Armitage! Your Legacy is going to live through millennia!"</p>
<p align="center"><strong>"I don't need that!"</strong> He insisted.</p>
<p align="center">"It's inevitable!" She said,<br/> "is there anything you require from us as a debt of our gratitude?"</p>
<p align="center">Hux was laughing,<br/> <strong>"I assure you, General, I don't require anything; I don't want anything, and I don't need anything, for I have all that I need! I just want you to take this gift from me, as my gratitude to you."</strong></p>
<p align="center">To Ben's dismay,<br/> And his Mother's curiosity,</p>
<p align="center">Hux reached within his chest pocket<br/> And pulled out the only blessed thing<br/> Within the Universe:<br/> Spider.</p>
<p align="center">He lay it on her palm,<br/> Encapsulating it within her hands,<br/> And kissing them.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>"My time for luck is done,"</strong> he said to her,<br/> <strong>"I truly have everything I need: A beautiful lover, people who believe in me, and a family in you and Ben.</strong></p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>I bid this to you, General, for you're going to need all the luck you can get if you wish to defeat the entirety of the First Order. This wooden spider has uncanny capabilities. It has helped Ben as it has helped me, and now it will help you. When it has helped you in the way it has helped us, then gift it to the next person you see fit."</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">Spider greeted Leia warmly,<br/> And kissed her thumb.<br/> She hugged Hux softly and thanked him<br/> For the gift,<br/> And when she let go,</p>
<p align="center">He stared at Ben with a smile,<br/> And he smiled back.</p>
<p align="center">It was no lie,<br/> Ben loved the way Hux looked at him.</p>
